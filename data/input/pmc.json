The aim of the present study was to reveal if the inoculated Lactic acid bacteria widely used in silage could provide beneficial safety to guarantee dairy feedstuffs and fresh milk. Organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) degradation in whole corn silage was investigated. Two OPPs, chlorpyrifos and phorate, were added to the whole corn, which was inoculated with L. plantarum 1.0315, L. plantarum 1.0624, L. plantarum 1.0622 and their combination at room temperature for 10 weeks. OPPs residues in the whole corn silage at different weeks were analyzed by gas chromatography after OPPs extraction and purification. The degradation rate constants were calculated according to the OPPs residues results at different fermentation stage. The data showed that the inoculated microorganisms and strain combination exhibited obvious acceleration on OPPs degradation as the wild microorganisms did, and resulted in decreased levels of OPPs from 24.9 to 33.4 %. Strains combination brought about greater OPPs degradation than single strain or the wild microorganisms. Compared to phorate, clorpyrifos had lower degradation rate constants (0.0274–0.0381 vs. 0.0295–0.0355 week−1) and was more stable. The present result indicates safety benefit of lactic acid bacteria on corn silage besides lactic acid fermentation.\n\nKeywords\nCorn silageChlorpyrifosPhorateDegradationLactobacillus plantarumhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809National Natural Science Foundation of China31571930Zhang Ying-Hua Open Research Fund for Key Laboratory of Dairy Science, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, China2012KLDSOF-05Zhang Ying-Hua issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nOrganophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) are a group of toxic agricultural chemicals widely used to control insect pests, plant pathogens, and weeds for plant protection to increase agricultural productivity. OPPs bring about enormous economic benefits to the farmers, and also raise potential risk to the health of animal especially humans (Sogorb et al. 2004). OPPs will pollute the environment eventually reach water (Na et al. 2006), soil (Cycón et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2004), animal feeds (Kumar et al. 2013). For example, OPPs were detected in the corn planted in Ghana (Akoto et al. 2013). The remaining OPPs in silage might not lead to the critical contamination of fresh milk and dairy products, but some analyses did observe OPPs residues in milk and dairy products (Tsiplakou et al. 2010; Battu et al. 2004). OPPs pollution in processed foods has been paid more and more attention all over the world (Abdel-Halim et al. 2006). There were some studies using microbial degradation to control OPPs (El Fantroussi and Agathos 2005; Fang et al. 2006), as biodegradation of the pesticides is considered as one of the safest and cheapest ways.\n\nLactic acid bacteria (LAB) as the natural intestinal microbiota of most animals (Rojo-Bezares et al. 2006), is one of the most common microorganisms in foods (De Vuyst and Leroy 2007), and also widely used in silage and inoculated in an effort to improve their preservation or quality (Addah et al. 2010; Danner et al. 2003; Filya 2003). Some intestinal microorganisms including LAB were efficient in degrading the OPPs (Harishankar et al. 2013). Two researchers reported that LAB had ability to enhance the degradation of some OPPs in the skimmed milk (Bo et al. 2011; Zhao and Wang 2012). Islam et al. (2010) revealed the OPPs biodegradation mechanism by expressing a gene encoding OPPs hydrolase enzyme from LAB. The phosphatase produced by LAB in the fermentation system might be the important factor for OPPs degradation (Zhang et al. 2014). L. plantarum as the main inoculants in the silage processing has the ability to accelerate OPPs degradation. Unfortunately, there were few researches studying OPPs degradation in silage. In the present study, OPPs degradation in whole corn silage was investigated. The potential impacts of three LAB including L. plantarum 1.0622, L. plantarum 1.0315 and L. plantarum 1.0624 on the degradation of chlorpyrifos and phorate were evaluated and compared, based on the calculated degradation kinetics of first-order reaction. The aim of the present study was to reveal if the inoculated LAB could provide beneficial safety guarantee to dairy feedstuffs and fresh milk.\n\nMaterials and methods\nMaterials\nChlorpyrifos and phorate were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Saint Louis, MO, USA.), with declared purity from 94.5 to 99.5 %, respectively, and stored at 4 °C before use.\n\nThree lactobacillus plantarum named L. plantarum 1.0315, L. plantarum 1.0624 and L. plantarum 1.0622 were obtained from the Centre of Lactic Acid Bacteria in Key Laboratory of Dairy Science, Ministry of Education, Northeast Agricultural, University (Harbin, China). The chemicals and solvents used were analytical and chromatographic agents. Water used was highly purified water prepared with Milli-Q PLUS (Millipore Corporation, New York, NY, USA).\n\nWhole corn from Xiangfang farm near Harbin was harvested on 20 September, 2013, and chopped into a length of 1–2 cm by a conventional forage harvester under farm conditions.\n\nSilage preparation\nThe following treatments were applied to whole corn to prepare three groups: (1) control groups (containing wild microorganisms), whole corn without any further treatment; (2) reference group (containing inactivated wild microorganisms), whole corn heated at 115 °C for 15 min to inactivate the wild microorganisms; (3) treated groups, whole corn subjected to heating inactivation and LAB inoculation. After the treatments, the whole corn in each group was spiked with chlorpyrifos and phorate at about 0.36 mg/kg by a hand sprayer, manually mixed well. After then, the whole corn in treated group was inoculated with the selected strains and combination, respectively, by a level of 1 × 106 cfu/g. All prepared samples were sealed in plastic bags and stored at room temperature (about 20 °C) for 10 weeks. During the storage, the samples in each group were assayed for the OPPs residues every week.\n\nSample extraction and purification\nSilage samples of 2.0 g and activated carbon of 0.2 g were mixed and extracted with 10 mL dichloromethane by a shaking for 10 min. The liquid phase was decanted to a separatory funnel, and the residues left were re-extracted twice with 10 mL dichloromethane. The collected liquid phase was joined and dried through anhydrous sodium sulphate (about 3 g) for 20 min. The dichloromethane phase of 5 mL was evaporated to dry at 30 °C by blowing nitrogen gas. The residues were reconstituted into 1.0 mL by acetone and filtered through a 0.45 μm microporous membrane before GC analysis.\n\nGC analysis of organophosphorus pesticides\nOPPs in the samples were quantified by an Agilent 7890 Gas Chromatography (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a capillary column (DB-1701, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm) and a flame photometric detector. Flow rate of the carrier gas (nitrogen gas) was 3 mL/min. The temperatures of injection, column and detector were set at 200, 90 and 250 °C, respectively. The purified sample (1.0 μL) was detected under programmed temperature gradient from initial temperature of 90 °C for 1 min, heating from 100 to 260 °C at 10 °C/min, holding for 3 min at 260 °C. Quantification of the pesticides was carried out by comparison of their peak areas with a calibrated standard curve with multitude-point calibration.\n\nThe relative decreasing levels of OPPs was calculated as the decreased concentrations of OPPs at the last week compared with the beginning ones.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll data were expressed as mean ± SD (standard deviations) from three independent trials. Kinetic parameters were calculated with linear regression analysis. SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the data.\n\nResults and discussion\nGC analysis of OPPs in corn silage\nA liquid–liquid extraction method is suitable method to extract OPPs thoroughly (Ballesteros and Parrado 2004), as the present study did. Typical GC profiles of the OPPs for a sample were given in Fig. 1, which showed both chlorpyrifos and phorate were well-separated. Detection limits of chlorpyrifos and phorate were 0.007 and 0.006 mg/kg, ensuring a precise measurement in the corn silage. The recoveries were 84.1–113.1 % (at 0.2–0.8 mg/kg spiking levels), with the standard deviations of 3.3 and 2.9 %, respectively (Table 1).Fig. 1 Typical GC profiles of two OPPs for a standard solution (a) and a corn silage sample (b), respectively. Peak 1 to 2 represent phorate, chlorpyrifos, respectively\n\nTable 1 Recoveries and detection limits of chlorpyrifos and phorate in corn silage\n\nPesticides\tRecoveries at three spiking levels (mg/kg)\tStandard deviations (%)\tDetection limits (mg/kg)\t\n0.20\t0.40\t0.80\t\nChlorpyrifos\t85.5\t85.8\t84.1\t3.3\t0.007\t\nPhorate\t90.9\t105.6\t113.1\t2.9\t0.006\t\n\n\nOPPs dissipation in corn silage\nIn the present study, three strains (L. plantarum) and their combinations were inoculated in fresh whole corn silage. The silage was then fermented at ambient temperature for 10 weeks. The assayed results indicated that OPPs had dissipated (Table 2), as the detected OPPs concentration in all samples showed a decrease trends. L. plantarum and their combinations inoculated in whole corn of five treated groups showed significant acceleration on OPPs dissipation, comparing to the OPPs dissipation in whole corn of reference group (with microorganism inactivation). After storage of 10 weeks, the decreasing levels for chlorpyrifos and phorate in the control group were 27.6 and 26.2 %, while those levels for chlorpyrifos and phorate in the reference group were only 7.3 and 7.5 %, respectively. The reference group was whole corn heated at 115 °C for 15 min to inactivate the microorganisms completely in order to avoid the effect of the wild microorganism. Promoting OPPs degradation by inoculated LAB in the treated groups was determined by comparing with the control. At the same time, the decreasing levels for chlorpyrifos and phorate in the treated groups ranged from 24.9 (phorate, incubated by L. plantarum 1.0624) to 33.4 % (phorate, incubated by L. plantarum 1.0622 and L. plantarum 1.0315). It thus was seen that the inoculated microorganisms also brought about OPPs dissipation, and the applied strain combinations had much stronger acceleration of OPPs dissipation than single strains and wild microorganisms. Unfortunately, single strain applied in the samples of treated groups resulted in similar OPPs dissipation as the wild microorganisms did in the samples of control groups. Application strain combination in the whole corn silage was thus suggested to grant much OPPs dissipation.Table 2 Measured concentration and degradation rate constants of chlorpyrifos and phorate in corn silage during storage\n\nPesticides\tStorage times (week)\tThe measured concentrations (mg/kg) in three groupsa\n\t\nControl\tReference\tTreated-A\tTreated-B\tTreated-C\tTreated-D\tTreated-E\t\nChlorpyrifos\t0\t0.359 ± 0.002\t0.342 ± 0.004\t0.363 ± 0.009\t0.355 ± 0.002\t0.354 ± 0.005\t0.358 ± 0.003\t0.360 ± 0.008\t\n1\t0.347 ± 0.009\t0.339 ± 0.007\t0.344 ± 0.010\t0.346 ± 0.004\t0.341 ± 0.007\t0.345 ± 0.008\t0.346 ± 0.003\t\n2\t0.337 ± 0.007\t0.338 ± 0.006\t0.325 ± 0.003\t0.331 ± 0.006\t0.326 ± 0.005\t0.325 ± 0.003\t0.326 ± 0.002\t\n3\t0.325 ± 0.006\t0.335 ± 0.003\t0.312 ± 0.003\t0.313 ± 0.006\t0.311 ± 0.002\t0.309 ± 0.002\t0.319 ± 0.003\t\n4\t0.311 ± 0.004\t0.333 ± 0.005\t0.299 ± 0.009\t0.301 ± 0.005\t0.299 ± 0.005\t0.301 ± 0.003\t0.308 ± 0.006\t\n5\t0.303 ± 0.009\t0.330 ± 0.005\t0.290 ± 0.003\t0.286 ± 0.004\t0.290 ± 0.003\t0.291 ± 0.004\t0.298 ± 0.006\t\n6\t0.295 ± 0.006\t0.326 ± 0.005\t0.271 ± 0.007\t0.278 ± 0.002\t0.286 ± 0.004\t0.285 ± 0.001\t0.287 ± 0.004\t\n7\t0.286 ± 0.008\t0.323 ± 0.004\t0.268 ± 0.005\t0.275 ± 0.001\t0.276 ± 0.003\t0.277 ± 0.001\t0.280 ± 0.004\t\n8\t0.281 ± 0.009\t0.321 ± 0.003\t0.265 ± 0.004\t0.270 ± 0.002\t0.273 ± 0.003\t0.273 ± 0.001\t0.272 ± 0.001\t\n9\t0.266 ± 0.004\t0.320 ± 0.004\t0.260 ± 0.001\t0.266 ± 0.002\t0.268 ± 0.002\t0.262 ± 0.001\t0.263 ± 0.002\t\n10\t0.260 ± 0.003\t0.317 ± 0.005\t0.255 ± 0.006\t0.264 ± 0.002\t0.264 ± 0.001\t0.257 ± 0.001\t0.259 ± 0.001\t\nPhorate\t0\t0.343 ± 0.003\t0.320 ± 0.009\t0.357 ± 0.009\t0.348 ± 0.001\t0.342 ± 0.003\t0.349 ± 0.003\t0.368 ± 0.002\t\n1\t0.335 ± 0.002\t0.318 ± 0.010\t0.325 ± 0.007\t0.328 ± 0.007\t0.328 ± 0.007\t0.339 ± 0.003\t0.345 ± 0.007\t\n2\t0.319 ± 0.008\t0.316 ± 0.011\t0.309 ± 0.007\t0.308 ± 0.005\t0.306 ± 0.009\t0.318 ± 0.008\t0.316 ± 0.004\t\n3\t0.317 ± 0.006\t0.315 ± 0.011\t0.297 ± 0.002\t0.304 ± 0.007\t0.305 ± 0.001\t0.317 ± 0.006\t0.310 ± 0.012\t\n4\t0.311 ± 0.004\t0.312 ± 0.009\t0.288 ± 0.001\t0.297 ± 0.008\t0.296 ± 0.007\t0.303 ± 0.007\t0.300 ± 0.005\t\n5\t0.296 ± 0.010\t0.310 ± 0.006\t0.279 ± 0.004\t0.283 ± 0.002\t0.285 ± 0.009\t0.291 ± 0.011\t0.288 ± 0.007\t\n6\t0.294 ± 0.001\t0.306 ± 0.003\t0.275 ± 0.003\t0.279 ± 0.004\t0.282 ± 0.003\t0.290 ± 0.008\t0.284 ± 0.002\t\n7\t0.288 ± 0.004\t0.303 ± 0.002\t0.269 ± 0.003\t0.275 ± 0.005\t0.276 ± 0.002\t0.275 ± 0.011\t0.274 ± 0.006\t\n8\t0.264 ± 0.001\t0.301 ± 0.006\t0.263 ± 0.003\t0.267 ± 0.009\t0.264 ± 0.004\t0.263 ± 0.010\t0.256 ± 0.008\t\n9\t0.263 ± 0.002\t0.299 ± 0.005\t0.255 ± 0.004\t0.262 ± 0.004\t0.262 ± 0.003\t0.262 ± 0.003\t0.254 ± 0.007\t\n10\t0.253 ± 0.001\t0.296 ± 0.008\t0.247 ± 0.004\t0.256 ± 0.001\t0.257 ± 0.004\t0.254 ± 0.003\t0.245 ± 0.006\t\n\naThe symbols A–E in treated groups represent the stains used.

The present result shared the same conclusion to these researches. Other LAB are capable of being applied in silage, their acceleration on OPPs dissipation needs a detailed investigation in future.\n\nDegradation kinetics of OPPs\nDegradation rate constants and half live periods of chlorpyrifos and phorate were calculated from the data in Table 2, based on a reported first-order reaction model (Vanclooster et al. 2000). The calculated results of degradation kinetics were listed in Table 3. The degradation of chlorpyrifos and phorate in whole corn during storage of 10 weeks fitted well to first-order reaction model, reflected by the regression coefficient R2 (0.945–0.996 for chlorpyrifos and 0.945–0.989 for phorate). Chlorpyrifos was more stable than phorate. Chlorpyrifos had lower rate constant (0.0295–0.0355 week−1), while phorate showed higher one (0.0274–0.0381 week−1). Further, L. plantarum combinations led to stronger OPPs degradation than the single strain only except L. plantarum 1.0622 for chlorpyrifos. The rate constants resulted by L. plantarum combinations were 0.0320–0.0381 week−1, while the rate constants resulted by single strain and wild microorganisms were 0.0274–0.0355 and 0.0300–0.0321 week−1, respectively.Table 3 Degradation kinetics of chlorpyrifos and phorate in corn silage cultured with lactic acid bacteria at room temperature\n\nPesticides\tSample groups and the inoculated strainsa\n\tParameters\t\n\nk (week−1)\t\nR\n2\n\t\nt\n1/2 (week)\t\nChlorpyrifos\tControl\t0.0321\t0.996\t21.6\t\nReference\t0.0078\t0.991\t88.9\t\nTreated-A\t0.0355\t0.957\t19.5\t\nTreated-B\t0.0317\t0.945\t21.9\t\nTreated-C\t0.0295\t0.961\t23.5\t\nTreated-D\t0.0323\t0.974\t21.5\t\nTreated-E\t0.0329\t0.990\t21.1\t\nPhorate\tControl\t0.0300\t0.972\t23.1\t\nReference\t0.0080\t0.989\t86.6\t\nTreated-A\t0.0322\t0.945\t21.5\t\nTreated-B\t0.0284\t0.961\t24.4\t\nTreated-C\t0.0274\t0.969\t25.3\t\nTreated-D\t0.0320\t0.985\t21.7\t\nTreated-E\t0.0381\t0.972\t18.2\t\n\nk degradation rate constant, R\n2 regression coefficient, t\n1/2 half life period\n\n\naThe symbols A–E in treated groups represent the stains used.

In a study of Sharma et al. (2005), degradation of some pesticides in wheat flour was also studied. Cho et al. (2009) found that chlorpyrifos could be degraded rapidly by LAB during the fermentation of Kimchi. These mentioned results were consistent with the present result. Unfortunately, the rate constants of chlorpyrifos and phorate in whole corn of control and treated groups were very low (about 0.0274–0.0381 week−1, Table 3). These values were equal to 1.63–2.27 × 10−4 h−1. On the contrary, the reported rate constants of some OPPs in milk were 0.0153–0.0420 h−1 (Zhao and Wang 2012). Three factors were considered here to be responsible for slow OPPs degradation in the whole corn. Firstly, the whole corn was kept in a lower temperature than the cultured milk, which might bring about lower OPPs degradation. Secondly, the whole corn was in solid state, which retarded the transportation of OPPs to the inoculated microorganisms. Lastly, the whole corn had much lower water activity than the milk, which might also be favor to the stability of the studied OPPs.\n\nIn conclusion, the inoculated L. plantarum strain and its combination, as well as wild microorganisms in planted corn all had accelerating effect on chlorpyrifos and phorate degradation during the storage, which led to greater dissipation of chlorpyrifos and phorate in the corn silage. Chlorpyrifos was more stable than phorate. Strain combinations totally showed greater acceleration on the degradation of chlorpyrifos and phorate, and thus should be more potential to practical application.

UpCoT generates orthologs for each gene in target genome using bi-directional best blast hit against the reference genomes, then identifies potential orthologous transcriptional units using intergenic distance. Finally it generates the FASTA files containing upstream sequences of orthologous transcriptional units of each gene in target genome. The inputs of UpCoT are protein sequence files (*.faa), genome sequence files (*.fna) and gene co-ordinate files (*.ptt) for target and reference genomes. The clustered-upstream DNA sequences can be used by motif prediction tool, such as MEME, Bio-prospector, Gibbs motif sampler, MDscan for prediction of conserved DNA elements. We tested the performance of UpCoT by selecting the genome of Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 as the target and 13 different cyanobacterial genomes as reference. The clustered upstream sequences generated by UpCoT of groES, ycf24 and nirA were used for cis-regulatory element prediction. The results were consistent with the experimentally identified cis-regulatory elements. Therefore, UpCoT is a reliable and automated pipeline package for prediction of orthologs, orthologous transcriptional units, and orthologous upstream sequences of a selected prokaryotic genome.

Identification of cis-regulatory elements and the trans-acting factors of a sequenced genome is one of the major challenges to computational biologists for building a global gene regulatory network. Phylogenetic footprinting is one of the widely accepted computational method for predicting cis-regulatory elements for a given genome in question (Hardison 2000). This method can be considered as a two step process. The first step involves, identification of orthologs in the reference genomes, for each protein of a target genome by bidirectional best hit method, prediction of transcriptional units of target and reference genomes, generation of cluster of transcriptional units (CoTs), and finally clustering of upstream DNA sequences based on the generated CoT data (Wels et al. 2006). The second step involves scanning for conserved DNA elements in the clustered-upstream DNA sequences of a given CoT. Various computational tools, such as MEME, Bioprospector, Gibbs sampler, MDScan are used for predicting conserved DNA elements in a given set of DNA sequences and can be represented in the form of consensus pattern (Bailey and Elkan 1994; Liu et al. 2001, 2002; Mrazek 2009; Neuwald et al. 1995). There are many computational tools to perform the second step of phylogenetic foot printing but, they are not available to perform the first step. Further, the first step by itself is a multi-step process and requires lengthy computational procedure. On the other hand, the number of microbial genomes being sequenced is constantly increasing and demands for the development of an automated tool. Developing such a tool would facilitate the biologists to work easily on any microbial genome for quick generation of clustered-upstream DNA sequences for the target genome in question. Keeping the above facts in view, we developed an automated integrated pipeline called, UpCoT, which identifies the orthologs for proteins of target organism (tgCoGs), generates clusters of transcription units (tgCoTs), and cluster the upstream DNA sequences of tgCoTs. The output of the UpCoT can be directly used for prediction of cis-regulatory elements using any computational tool of user’s choice.\n\nMaterials and methods\nDesign of UpCoT interface\nUpCoT web interface was designed using HTML, PHP and javascript to select and retrieve the genomes for analysis by UpCoT package. The *.faa, *.fna, and *.ptt files of 1840 prokaryotic genomes were downloaded from NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria) and incorporated in the web server, where UpCoT package has been maintained. User can select any of these genomes as target and reference files as input to UpCoT package. UpCoT package along with selected genomes for analysis can be downloaded from the web link, http://jssplab.uohyd.ac.in/upcot. The UpCoT package was developed using Perl programming language and is compatible for Windows and Linux operating systems.\n\nDescription and accessibility of UpCoT web interface\nThe web interface contains ‘Home’, ‘Help’ and ‘Contact’ links below the header. A brief introduction about the UpCoT is given in the homepage. A single click on ‘Select Genomes’ link navigates to a new web page displaying the list of prokaryotic genomes for selection as target genome. User can also select either windows or linux operating system, for downloading suitable executables to run the UpCoT package. Upon selecting the operating system and the target organism, a new page appears and prompts the user for selecting the reference genomes. Here the user can select any number of reference genomes for analysis and then click on the submit button. After the selection of both target and reference genomes, user can download the UpCoT package by a single click on ‘Download UpCoT’ tab. The UpCoT windows version needs a supporting software package GNU on windows to be installed, which is provided along with UpCoT package. UpCoT package also contains ‘settings.txt’, ‘README.txt’, ‘target_genome.txt’, and ‘reference_genomes.txt’ files (Fig. 1a). User may change the parameters, such as E value (default, d = 1 e−3), orthologs count (default = 4), computer configuration (default = 64 bit), installation path of GNU on window (in case of windows user), minimum upstream length (min_UP length default = 50) and maximum upstream length (max_UP length default = 350 bp), in “settings.txt” file provided in the package (Fig. 1b). The “bin” directory provided in the UpCoT contains Perl programs developed for performing different tasks such as blastP, extraction of top scoring hits, prediction of bidirectional best hits, counting the number of orthologs, upstream sequence retrieval, and generating clustered-upstream sequences.Fig. 1 \na Snapshot showing the directories, and files present in the UpCoT package. The “bin” directory contains Perl programs needed for running of UpCoT. The ‘genomes’ directory contains *.faa, *.fna, *.ptt files of selected target and reference genomes. ‘Read_Me.txt’ provides the instructions about how to use UpCoT package. The file ‘settings.txt’ provides the input parameters, as mentioned in b. The ‘upcot.pl’ is the main file which invokes all the Perl programs that are present in “bin” directory. b Snapshot showing the file contents of ‘settings.txt’. E value cutoff to be used for prediction of bidirectional best hits (d = default, 1 e\n−3). User may change this value before running UpCoT. Number of orthologs present in each tgCoG. When value is set to 4, all tgCoGs containing minimum 4 orthologs and above are selected for further analysis. Max_UP_length maximum length of the upstream region to be considered by UpCoT. Configuration of the computer (32- or 64-bit). Path of GNU on Windows installation directory. Min_UP_length minimum length of upstream region to be considered by UpCoT\n\n\n\nUpCoT output\nUpCoT identifies the orthologs for each protein of target genome by bidirectional best hit method (BDBH) in the given reference genomes using BlastP (Altschul et al. 1990). After performing BDBH, UpCoT generates clusters of orthologs groups for target genome (tgCoGs) based on the orthologs count. For example, if the orthologs count is set to 4, tgCoGs containing four orthologs or above will be selected for further analysis. A directory named as “tgCoG_protein_sequences” is generated containing FASTA files of tgCoG protein sequences. In addition, UpCoT generates clusters of transcriptional units (tgCoTs) by reading the tgCoG files and also based on the length of their corresponding upstream DNA sequences. The minimum length of the upstream region (min_UP length default = 50) and the maximum length of the upstream region (max_UP length default = 350). It excludes the upstreams of the open reading frames, which are less than the defined nucleotide length. Reports suggest that the genes possessing an upstream region less than 40–50 bp are to be excluded from the computational prediction of cis-regulatory elements, we have set the minimum default integer value as 50 bp in the “settings.txt” file (Fig. 1b) (Conlan et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2008; Salgado et al. 2000). User may change the minimum length as per the requirement. When the actual length of the upstream region is greater than the minimum default length or user-defined minimum length, the program selects 350 bp upstream region of an ORF. When the upstream intergenic region is longer than 350 bp, the UpCoT considers only 350 bp upstream region, as the max_UP length is set to 350 bp. User may also change the max_length according to the requirement. Subsequently, UpCoT extracts and clusters the upstream DNA sequences of tgCoTs based on default or user defined integer values as upstream length given in “settings.txt” file. Upon completion of the whole process, a directory named “tu_upstreams” appears in the working directory of the UpCoT. This directory contain multiple text files, each with clustered-upstream DNA sequences of a tgCoT. Each text file is named with ORF number of the target gene. User can submit these upstream sequences for any motif prediction tool for identifying cis-regulatory elements. The entire work flow of UpCoT including inputs, the processes, and the outputs are depicted in (Fig. 2).Fig. 2 The schematic representation of the UpCoT input, UpCoT work flow and UpCoT output. The inputs for UpCoT are *.faa, *.fna, *.ptt files of target and reference genomes of user’s choice. UpCoT uses these files to generate tgCoGs by Bidirectional best hit method (BDBH) and the clusters of transcriptional units (tgCoTs). UpCoT groups the upstreams of each gene of a tgCoT to generate clustered-DNA upstreams of that tgCoT. All clustered-DNA upstreams of each tgCoT are saved into ‘tu-upstreams’ directory. Each output file is a text file named with ‘Up-ORF id’ of the target organism. UpCoT also generates the tgCoG protein sequences as text files. G1 tgCoT of gene 1, P1 tgCoG of gene 1, Up-Gn clustered-upstream sequences of gene ‘n’ of a target genome\n\n\n\nMethodology used for testing UpCoT\nWe used the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) as the target and Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017, Synechococcus CC 9311, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301, Cyanothece PCC 7424, Synechococcus JA 2 3B a 2 13, Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, Synechococcus PCC 7002, Microcystis aeruginosa NIES 843, Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP1, Prochlorococcus marinus MIT 9303, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS 101 as reference genomes. We used the default E value (d = 1 e−3), ortholog count as 4 and min_UP length as 50 and max_UP length as 500 bp for testing UpCoT. From the output generated by UpCoT, the text files with names Slr2075, Slr0074 and Slr0898 were selected from ‘tu_upstreams’ directory and submitted for the prediction of cis-regulatory elements using stand alone versions of MEME, Gibbs Motif Sampler, MDScan and Bioprospector.\n\nResults and discussion\nPerformance analysis of UpCoT\nThe target genome, Synechocystis has 3172 open reading frames that code for proteins involved in various cellular processes and unknown proteins. Out of 3172 proteins, UpCoT has generated 2578 tgCoGs, each containing minimum four orthologs. This shows that 81 % of Synechocystis proteins are present in at least four selected cyanobacterial species. Orthologs identified by UpCoT for the selected proteins were retrieved from ‘tgCoG_protein_sequences’ directory and tested for accuracy. Table 1 shows the selected proteins and their orthologs along with their functional annotation. From (Table 1), it is clear that the orthologs identified by UpCoT for the proteins Slr2075 (GroES), Slr0074 (Ycf24), Slr0898 (NirA), Ssl2598 (PsbH), Smr0009 (PsbN), Sll0851 (PsbC) andSll0894 (PsbD) are accurate because their annotations are same as given in NCBI genome database.Table 1 Orthologs identified by UpCoT for selected proteins of target organism, Synechocystis sp.

Functional annotation is given in parenthesis and is based on NCBI genome database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria)\n\n\n\nAnalysis of clustered-upstream DNA sequences for selected tgCoTs\nUpCoT has generated 2578 text files each containing clustered-upstream DNA sequences of a tgCoT. Out of which, the clustered upstream DNA sequences of slr2075, slr0074 and slr0898 were submitted for cis-regulatory element prediction, as the regulatory elements for these genes were previously experimentally demonstrated to be the target sites for known transcription factors. The clustered-upstreams were submitted to four different motif prediction tools as described in the materials and methods. (Table 2) shows the predicted cis-regulatory elements which were identified in the clustered-upstreams of the above selected tgCoTs. In Synechocystis the gene slr2075 encodes for co-chaperonin GroES. HrcA, a transcriptional repressor has been reported regulate the expression of the groESL operon by binding to a 9-bp inverted repeat TTAGCACTC [N9] GAGTGCTAA (Nakamoto et al. 2003; Zuber and Schumann 1994). When the clustered-upstream sequences of slr2075-tgCoT was submitted as input to motif prediction tools the same inverted repeat was predicted by MEME, Gibbs motif sampler and Bioprospector (Table 2). The SufR is a negative transcriptional regulator of sufBCDS operon in Synechocystis. SufR binds to cis-acting element, CAAC-N6-GTTG located between the divergently transcribed sufR gene and the sufBCDS operon, and acts as a repressor of the sufBCDS operon and as an auto-regulator of its own gene, sufR (Wang et al. 2004). Motif prediction tools MEME, MDScan and Bioprospector generated the same element upon submission of clustered-upstream sequences of slr0074-tgCoT (Table 2). A number of nitrogen assimilation genes are regulated by the global transcriptional regulator NtcA, that acts as both an activator and repressor (Aichi et al. 2001). The binding site of NtcA is reported to be a tri-nucleotide inverted repeat GTA N(8) TAC. The ORF, slr0898 codes for Ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (NirA) in Synechocystis. Bioprospector tool has predicted the NtcA binding site in the clustered-upstream DNA sequences of tgCoT-slr0898 (Table 2). Thus, based on the identification of experimentally validated cis-regulatory elements for clustered upstreams oftgCoTs, we suggest that UpCoT is suitable for extracting and clustering of upstreams for any group of microbial genomes with accuracy and can be used for phylogenetic foot printing, promoter prediction, sRNA mapping and TSS prediction.Table 2 \ncis-regulatory elements identified in the clustered-upstreams of selected tgCoTs generated by UpCoT\n\nThe clustered-upstreams of slr2075-tgCoT (Up_slr2075_CoT), slr0074-tgCoT (Up_slr0074_CoT) and slr0898-tgCoT (Up_slr0898_CoT) were submitted to MEME, Gibbs Motif Sampler, MDScan and Bioprospector tools for identifying cis-regulatory elements. The predicted cis-regulatory elements are shown as a consensus sequence. The predicted conserved sequences were consistent with the previously published and experimentally validated cis-regulatory elements\n\n\n\nConclusion\nUpCoT is an automated software that can perform prediction of bidirectional best hits, clusters of transcriptional units (tgCoTs) and grouping of upstream DNA sequences for the predicted tgCoTs in a single step. It can be used as a tool by biologists to work on available microbial genomes for prediction of cis-regulatory elements using phylogenetic foot printing.

Different immobilization matrices/mediums (alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, agarose gel, polyacrylamide, gelatin, and κ-carrageenan) were studied to immobilize Candida tropicalis NCIM 3123 cells for xylitol production. Amongst this calcium alginate, immobilized cells produced maximum amount of xylitol with titer of 11.1 g/L and yield of 0.34 g/g. Hence, the process for immobilization using calcium alginate beads was optimized using a statistical method with sodium alginate (20, 30 and 40 g/L), calcium chloride (10, 20 and 30 g/L) and number of freezing–thawing cycles (2, 3 and 4) as the parameters. Using optimized conditions (calcium chloride 10 g/L, sodium alginate 20 g/L and 4 number of freezing–thawing cycles) for immobilization, xylitol production increased significantly to 41.0 g/L (4 times the initial production) with corn cob hydrolysate as sole carbon source and urea as minimal nutrient source. Reuse of immobilized biomass showed sustained xylitol production even after five cycles.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-016-0388-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nCandida tropicalisImmobilizationCalcium alginateCorn cob hemicellulosic hydrolysateissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\n\nThe increasing demand and exorbitant cost of low calorie polyol like xylitol open up challenge for making low-cost xylitol from renewable feedstock. Xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar alcohol sweetener, that has sweetness similar to sucrose but 40 % lower energy, negative heat of dissolution, low viscosity in solution, absence of the Maillard reaction, higher chemical stability, and several biomedical properties (Bär et al. 1991). Emil Fisher was the first to synthesize xylitol by reacting xylose with sodium amalgam in 1891 (Bär et al. 1991). Xylitol is beneficial for nutrition (Sreenivas-Rao et al. 2006), for prevention of dental caries (Emidi 1978) and low-calorie food preparation for diabetic patients (Pepper and Olinger 1988) but these applications are limited due to high cost of xylitol produced by chemical means. The selling cost for xylitol is 6–7 $/kg for bulk purchase (Rafiqul and Sakinath 2013). Xylitol is currently manufactured by chemical hydrogenation of pure d-xylose in the presence of nickel catalyst at elevated temperature and pressure, yielding a product with a high purity (>99.5 %) and a yield of 50–60 % with respect to the initial xylose (Dieters 1975; Ojamo et al. 2009). Alternatively, xylitol can be produced by biological process which shows certain advantages like milder conditions of pressure, temperature, pH, agitation, cell inhibitors and lower costs of downstream processing due to the production of lower amounts of by-products (Saha 2003). However, carbon source and operating cost must be economically competitive to ensure the feasibility of the process. Corn cob, a major waste obtained in corn production and is a promising and attractive alternative for xylose rich hemicellulosic hydrolysate stream (Rivas et al. 2003).\n\nWhile comparing with the free cell system, the immobilized microorganism system can be used to improve the fermentation performance and to reduce the overall production costs (Roberto et al. 1991). Immobilized cell bioprocesses becomes obvious and most preferred solution because they allow higher fermentation rates, permit high cell concentration, reuse of cells for extended time, reduce costs related to inoculum development, protect the entrapped biocatalyst from inhibitors, prevent washout and provide ease of separation of biocatalyst from fermentation broth (Jirku et al. 2000). Cell immobilization via gel entrapment is widely used in bench-scale tests, and many gel-like materials are used as carriers, which may be based on natural (alginate, κ-carrageenan, agarose, agar, chitosan, etc.) or synthetic (polyacrylamide, polyacrylate, polyurethane, etc.) polymers or precursors (Lozinsky et al. 1997). Among these supports screened for yeast cell immobilization to perform xylose-to-xylitol bioconversion, calcium alginate support has received more attention in biomedical and food industries due to properties viz. integrity, minimal mass transfer limitation, cheap, non-toxic, mild conditions and utilizes ingredients that are accepted as food additive (Champagne et al. 2000). The productivity of immobilized system is affected by three parameters, i.e. calcium chloride, sodium alginate and number of freezing–thawing cycles (Cunha et al. 2009). However, limited number of studies report optimized conditions for immobilization of Candida and even so, most of these studies use detoxified hydrolysate for fermentation (Wang et al. 2009; Carvalho et al. 2003, 2004; Cheng et al. 2009; El-Batal and Khalaf 2004; Liaw et al. 2008; Deng et al. 2006; Sarrouh et al. 2007; Gyan et al. 2011). Inclusion of the detoxification step results in an increase in the overall production cost. It is therefore, desirable to use non-detoxified hydrolysate. Hence, the present work was undertaken with an objective to enhance xylitol production from non-detoxified corn cob hydrolysate using statistically optimized immobilized process for entrapping the cells.\n\nMaterials and methods\nRaw material and chemicals\nCorn cob was provided by Abhyoday feedstock suppliers, Jalgaon, India. These are air-dried and milled into small particles (3.5 mm × 2.5 mm) before acid hydrolysis. Aminex column HPX87H (300 mm × 7.8 mm) was purchased from Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA. All used chemicals were of analytical grade. Sodium alginate, calcium chloride and sodium citrate were procured from Himedia, Mumbai.\n\nPreparation of corn cob hydrolysate\nThe composition of corn cob used in this study contained 3–5 % w/w of moisture, and the remaining dry matter was made up 60 % w/w of total reducing sugars, of which 25.0 % w/w hemicellulose and 35 % w/w cellulose, 23.0 % w/w lignin and 3 % w/w ash, 3.0 % w/w protein, 1.0 % w/w uronic acid and 2.0 % acetates.\n\nCorn cob contains various components such as lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, various extractives and inorganic components. Corn cob hydrolysate was obtained by Praj patented pretreatment procedure (Pal et al. 2013). This pretreatment involved corn cob solid of 15–20 % w/w, dilute acid concentration of 1–3 % w/w, screw speed of 2–4 rpm, reaction temperature of 160–180 °C and reaction time of 15–20 min. Then the corn cob slurry and aqueous solution after reaction were discharged, and separated in a solid–liquid separation equipment. The obtained supernatant was rich in xylose concentration, and the main composition was (w/w) xylose 4–6 %, glucose 0.5–1.0 %, arabinose 0.1–0.3 %, acetic acid 0.2–0.6 %, furfural 100–300 ppm, hydroxy methyl furfural 100–500 ppm, galactose 0 %, mannose 0 % and phenolics 2500–4000 ppm.\n\nMicroorganism and inoculum cultivation\nCandida tropicalis NCIM 3123 was purchased from National Collection of Industrial Microorganism (NCIM), Pune and maintained on MXYP agar slants (containing malt extract, 3 g/L; xylose, 20 g/L, yeast extract, 3 g/L, peptone, 5 g/L and agar, 20 g/Lat pH 7.0) at 4 °C. The microorganism was sub cultured every 2 weeks. A loopful of C. tropicalis strain from the 24-h-old slants maintained on MXYP agar slants were inoculated into 50 mL of inoculum medium containing (g/L) xylose, 20.0; yeast extract, 3.0; malt extract, 3.0; and peptone, 5.0 at pH 6.5 in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and was allowed to incubate for 24 h at 30 °C with agitation at 150 rpm. Harvested culture broth was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C temperature. The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was washed twice with sterile distilled water and further used for immobilization studies.\n\nPreparation of immobilized cells\nEntrapment in sodium alginate\nAn adequate volume of cell suspension was added to sterilized 20 mL of 4 % (w/v) sodium alginate prepared in distilled water to get cell concentration of 6 g/L. The slurry was extruded through a syringe into 0.2 M calcium chloride solution with constant stirring. The beads were allowed to cure in 0.2 M calcium chloride solution for 24 h at 4 °C followed by washing with sterile distilled water 3–4 times, and they were preserved in sterile distilled water until use.\n\nEntrapment in polyvinyl alcohol\nSterile aqueous solution containing 2 % w/v sodium alginate and 11 % w/v polyvinyl alcohol were mixed with the thick cell suspension so as to reach a cell concentration of 6 g/L (dry weight). The mixture was then passed through syringe needle (18 gauge) into calcium chloride (40 g/L) with use of peristaltic pump. The beads were maintained in the calcium chloride solution at 4 °C for 3 h. Afterwards, they were washed with sterile distilled water.\n\nEntrapment in agarose gel\nAn adequate yeast cell suspension was added to the sterile 3 % w/v agarose solution maintained at 40 °C to reach concentration of 6 g/L, mixed well with stirring and poured into sterile petri plate and allowed to solidify. The resultant block was cut into equal size cubes and added to sterile distilled water and kept in refrigerator (1 h) for curing. After curing, sterile water was decanted and the cubes were then washed 3–4 times with sterile distilled water and stored in same for further use.\n\nWhole cell immobilization in polyacrylamide\nAn adequate yeast cell suspension was mixed with 15 mL of 12 % w/v polyacrylamide solution, 15 mL of distilled water, 3 mL sterile water, 200 μL ammonium persulphate (0.4 gm/mL), and 50 μL TEMED to reach cell concentration of 6 g/L and allowed to polymerize on a sterile petri plate for 1 h. The polymer sheet was cut into cubes (4 mm), rinsed in sterile distilled water and stored at 4 °C for curing for 3 h. The cubes were then washed 3–4 times with sterile distilled water and stored in same till further use.\n\nWhole cell immobilization in gelatin\nAn adequate volume of yeast cell suspension was added to 15 mL of 6 % w/v sterile gelatin maintained at 45 °C, and poured into a sterile petri dish. The gel was over layered with 10 μL of 5 % w/v glutaraldehyde for hardening at 30 °C. The resulting block was cut into small-size cubes (4 mm) and the cubes were washed thoroughly with sterile distilled water for complete removal of excess glutaraldehyde. The cubes were then washed 3–4 times with sterile distilled water and stored in same till further use.\n\nWhole cell immobilization in κ-carrageenan\nSaline solution containing 4 % w/v κ-carrageenan was heated to 60 °C for complete dissolution, and allowed to cool at 40 °C. Then, it was mixed with an adequate volume of yeast cell suspension to get cell concentration of 6 g/L at 32–35 °C without affecting cell viability. The mixture was pumped slowly to 2 % w/v KCl solution to induce gelation. The gel were then washed 3–4 times with sterile distilled water and stored in sterile water till further use.\n\nScreening of different matrices for immobilization of Candida tropicalis cells for xylitol production\nThe fermentation performance and bead integrity evaluation was performed by direct contact with non-detoxified stream of corn cob pentose hydrolysate. Fermentation was carried out in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 200 mL of fermentation media. This media consists of xylose concentration of 40–60 g/L for respective stream with 500 ppm urea as nutritional component. Initial pH of media was adjusted to 6.5 using calcium hydroxide. The fermentation was carried out on rotary shaker at 150 rpm and 30 °C. The quantity of immobilised beads was added as inoculum in different flask so that each flask contains equal number of cells like that of free cell fermentation as control.\n\nOptimization of immobilization condition in sodium alginate by statistical method\nThe yeast cells were immobilized by encapsulation in calcium alginate beads by use of freezing–thawing method (Levia et al. 2013). An adequate volume of cell suspension was added to sterile 20 mL of 20, 30 and 40 g/L of sodium alginate prepared in distilled water to get final cell concentration of 6 g/L. The slurry was extruded through a syringe into calcium chloride solution of 10, 20 and 30 g/L with constant stirring. The beads were allowed to cure in calcium chloride solution for 24 h at 4 °C followed by washing with sterile distilled water 3–4 times, and submitted to the freezing–thawing cycles at −20 °C. The levels for each variable used are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Experimental matrix of full factorial design of experiments and xylitol yield (Y\np/s), volumetric productivity (Q\nP) and encapsulation efficiency in the pellet (EE), after 96-h fermentation according to 23 full factorial design\n\nTest run\tCoded variable\tResponse\t\nSA (%)\tCC (%)\tFTN (no. of cycles)\t\nY\np/s (g/g)\t\nQ\nP (g/L/h)\tEE (%)\t\n1\t−1 (2.0)\t−1 (1.0)\t−1 (2)\t0.61 ± 0.01\t0.26 ± 0.01\t99.21 ± 0.42\t\n2\t+1 (4.0)\t−1 (1.0)\t−1 (2)\t0.52 ± 0.02\t0.18 ± 0.02\t99.44 ± 0.20\t\n3\t−1 (2.0)\t+1 (3.0)\t−1 (2)\t0.58 ± 0.01\t0.24 ± 0.01\t99.67 ± 0.23\t\n4\t+1 (4.0)\t+1 (3.0)\t−1 (2)\t0.56 ± 0.02\t0.20 ± 0.01\t99.49 ± 0.26\t\n5\t−1 (2.0)\t−1 (1.0)\t+1 (4.0)\t0.74 ± 0.01\t0.40 ± 0.00\t99.94 ± 0.04\t\n6\t+1 (4.0)\t−1 (1.0)\t+1 (4)\t0.71 ± 0.01\t0.39 ± 0.0\t99.59 ± 0.12\t\n7\t−1 (2.0)\t+1 (3.0)\t+1 (4)\t0.71 ± 0.01\t0.40 ± 0.01\t99.37 ± 0.05\t\n8\t+1 (4.0)\t+1 (3.0)\t+1 (4)\t0.71 ± 0.01\t0.40 ± 0.00\t99.37 ± 0.40\t\n9\t0 (1.0)\t0 (2.0)\t0 (3)\t0.50 ± 0.01\t0.16 ± 0.01\t99.66 ± 0.36\t\n10\t0 (1.0)\t0 (2.0)\t0 (3)\t0.51 ± 0.01\t0.17 ± 0.01\t99.67 ± 0.23\t\n11\t0 (1.0)\t0 (2.0)\t0 (3)\t0.51 ± 0.01\t0.18 ± 0.01\t99.76 ± 0.22\t\n\nSA sodium alginate, CC calcium chloride, FTN freezing–thawing cycle no. Yield (Y\np/s); productivity, Q\nP (g/L/h); Immobilization efficiency, EE (%)\n\n\n\nA 23 level full factorial design with 8 axial point and 3 replicates at the center point with total of 11 experiments was employed (Box et al. 1978) This design was used to select the optimal immobilization conditions like concentration of sodium alginate, calcium chloride and number of freezing–thawing cycles, to enhance the fermentation performance, bead integrity and to reduce mass transfer limitation. As mentioned in Table 1, selected three independent factors were controlled at two levels (−, +), namely 20 and 40 g/L for the sodium alginate concentration (SA), 10 and 30 g/L for the calcium chloride concentration (CC), and (2 and 4) for the number of freezing–thawing cycles (FTN). These factors and levels were suggested by previous results obtained with Candida spp. cell and yeast cells immobilized onto other supports, polyvinyl alcohol (Cunha et al. 2007, 2009), polyurethane foam (Wang et al. 2009) calcium alginate (Carvalho et al. 2005; Milessi et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2012; Lotfipour et al. 2012) under different conditions.\n\nFermentation media conditions for statistical design of experiments\nThe non-detoxified stream was heated at 80 °C for 10 min after pH adjustment to 6.5 with calcium hydroxide and supplemented with 500 ppm urea as a nitrogen source. Batch fermentation were carried out in duplicate in Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL fermentation media with corn cob hydrolysate in 250 mL flask and 15 g of wet beads containing cells. The flasks were maintained on rotary shaker at 150 rpm and 30 °C. The effects of the immobilization variables on xylose-to-xylitol conversion as well as on the encapsulation efficiency by the support were investigated through statistical concepts using the Statgraphics program (version 16.0). To this purpose, the yield of xylitol on consumed xylose (Yp/s), the xylitol volumetric productivity (QP), and the encapsulation efficiency (EE) were selected as the responses. Yp/s was calculated as the ratio of amount of xylitol produced at the end of fermentation to the amount of xylose consumed, QP as the ratio of maximum xylitol concentration to the fermentation time, The immobilization efficiency (Yi, %) was calculated as the ratio of concentration of immobilized cells (Xi, g/L) to the concentration of total (suspended plus immobilized) cells (XT, g/L) and multiplying by 100.\n\nThe fermentation efficiency of xylose to xylitol was calculated as the ratio of the net amount of xylitol produced (g/L) to the initial xylose (g/L) of the medium, The conversion efficiency was calculated as the ratio of difference between initial xylose (g/L) and the residual xylose (g/L) to the initial xylose (g/L) in the medium.\n\nPerformance evaluation studies in shake flask\nThe calcium alginate beads were prepared using the optimum concentration of sodium alginate 20 g/L, calcium chloride 10 g/L and 4 number of freezing–thawing cycles at −20 °C. The fermentation performance was evaluated in 500 mL shake flask containing 200 mL of non-detoxified hydrolysate media (55–60 g/L of xylose, 500 ppm urea and pH was adjusted to 6.5 with calcium hydroxide). Media was sterilized at 80 °C for 10 min in a vertical autoclave (Equitronics, Media instruments, Mumbai). Media was inoculated with 15 g of wet beads and operated at agitation of 150 rpm and temperature of 30 °C. Samples were periodically removed and analyzed for xylose and xylitol.\n\nRecyclability study of beads in non-detoxified pentose hydrolysate\nThe treated hydrolysate was heated at 80 °C for 10 min and supplemented with urea (0.5 g/L), before being used as a fermentation medium. pH was adjusted to 6.5 with calcium hydroxide. Duplicate repeated-batch fermentation runs were carried out in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing and 100 mL of fermentation medium and 10 g of immobilized biocatalysts. The flasks were maintained in a rotary shaker at 150 rpm and 30 °C for 96 h. After each run/cycle, the fermented medium was discarded, the solid carrier with immobilized cells were carefully drained and gently washed with water to eliminate all non-adhering yeast cells and the immobilized biocatalysts were charged with fresh medium. At the end of each cycle amount of xylitol produced was estimated and the process was carried out using the same immobilized cells for successive cycles.\n\nAnalysis\nCell concentration in the resulting suspension was determined by optical density (OD) measurements at 640 nm, using a spectrophotometer, model U-2900 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The control was the fermentation medium without cells and corn cob hydrolysate particles to avoid any interference of solids on the OD measurements. The immobilized cell concentration was estimated by the same method after dissolution of beads in 0.1 M sodium citrate solution.\n\nA previously constructed calibration curve was used to relate the OD measurements to dry cell concentration in samples of both this suspension and those used for inoculum. Sugar and xylitol concentrations were measured by HPLC, system of Agilent Technologies, 1200 series, model 1200 series (Agilent technologies, CA, USA), equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H (300 × 7.8 mm) column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and a refractive index G 1362 A detector, an G 1316 B column Oven and G 1311 A pump. Samples were previously filtered through 0.22 µ filter and injected in the column under the following conditions: injection volume of 20 µL, column temperature of 45 °C, 0.05 M H2SO4 as the mobile phase used at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min.\n\nResults and discussion\nIn this study, yeast immobilization conditions in calcium alginate were established through the factorial design as mentioned earlier. The research work is distributed in three stages. The first stage involved screening of various matrices to produce xylitol by fermentation in non-detoxified corn corb hydrolysate and to select the matrix with best xylitol fermentation efficiency and stability of matrices in maintaining the shape in corn cob hydrolysate media. Second stage dealt with influence of sodium alginate concentration, calcium chloride concentration and number of freezing–thawing cycles on xylitol yield (Yp/s), volumetric productivity (QP) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) by the support at shake flask level fermentation study and third stage studied the fermentation using immobilized beads prepared using statistically optimized conditions.\n\nScreening of various matrices used for immobilization for Candida tropicalis in non-detoxified corn cob hydrolysate\nFigure 1 represents comparative study of stability and fermentation efficiency of immobilized beads or gel with C. tropicalis cells in non-detoxified corn cob hydrolysate for xylitol production. Polymers like sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, agar, gelatin, polyacrylamide and κ-carrageenan were used as immobilization matrices to form beads or gels. Out of these polymers, beads were formed with sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol and gel formation done with agar, gelatin, polyacrylamide and κ-carrageenan. Shake flask fermentation study with these matrices in non-detoxified corn cob hydrolysate resulted into dissolution of gels like gelatin and κ-carrageenan just after addition. Polyvinyl alcohol bead, agarose and polyacrylamide gels were dissolved in non-detoxified media in first cycle. Only calcium alginate beads were not dissolved and maintained their spherical shape even after first cycle of reaction. Higher xylitol fermentation efficiency of 30 %, observed with calcium alginate as compared to all other polymers. Further optimization was required to match the efficiency of free cells used as control. Out of these four polymers, calcium alginate beads were selected for further study and optimization due to their integrity, stability, reusability and high fermentation efficiency among all supports.Fig. 1 Comparative fermentation study of various matrices in relation to residual xylose and xylitol produced after 96 h in non-detoxified hydrolysate. Black bar xylose and grey bar xylitol\n\n\n\nBeads preparation and fermentation performance evaluation\nBead preparation was carried out using full factorial design. The obtained responses indicated that the beads obtained in each run were effective to perform the bioconversion and to maintain the integrity in non-detoxified corn cob hemicellulosic hydrolysate. One of the important point observed was that encapsulation efficiency (EE) observed in each run was more than 99.0 %. The fermentation performance obtained for each run was as shown in Table 1. The xylitol yield, volumetric productivity, and encapsulation efficiency within the pellet were found to be varying in the ranges 0.40–0.74 g/g, 0.17–0.40 g/L/h, and 99.21–99.94 %, respectively.\n\nStatistical data analysis\nFigure 2 shows the Pareto charts for each response variable. From analysis of Pareto charts and Anova table it can be concluded that xylitol yield, productivity and immobilization efficiency were not influenced by sodium alginate, calcium chloride concentration and freezing–thawing cycle number (p value > 0.05). The p value revealed that xylitol yield and xylitol productivity was only moderately influenced by the freezing–thawing cycle number (80 % < significance < 95 %). Although a very negligible effect of calcium chloride was observed on yield, productivity and immobilization efficiency, moderately significant interactive effect of calcium chloride and freeze thaw cycle no was observed on immobilization efficiency (80 % < significance < 95 %). Insignificant interactive effects were observed for yield and productivity. The optimum levels for the variables obtained by use of statgraphics software were sodium alginate (2 % w/v), calcium chloride (1.0 % w/v) and 4 number of freezing and thawing cycle.Fig. 2 Pareto charts of independent variables and their interaction on each response variable. a Yield, b productivity, c immobilization efficiency\n\n\n\nFermentations with immobilized cell pellet in shake flask\nFigure 3a shows the consumption pattern for different sugars like glucose, xylose, arabinose, acetic acid and xylitol production during fermentations performed in shake flask on a medium based on corn cob hemicellulosic hydrolysate and with pellets prepared using sodium alginate concentration of 20 g/L, calcium chloride concentration of 10 g/L and four freezing–thawing cycles at freezing temperature of −20 °C.Fig. 3 Fermentation profile of xylose to xylitol using optimized immobilized beads. a Consumption of xylose, arabinose, glucose and acetic acid as well as xylitol production. b Profile of fermentation performance with immobilized bead in shake flask (initial xylose, 57.2 g/L; pH 5.92; Temperature 30 °C). c Concentration profile of free cells, cells immobilized in the calcium alginate and pH during fermentation of corn cob hemicellulosic hydrolysate. Error bars represent variation between the duplicate trials\n\n\n\nAs shown in the Fig. 3a glucose was the preferred substrate as compared to xylose. Glucose was consumed within first 12–24 h only. The presence of glucose is responsible for biomass formation (Yahashi et al. 1996), ethanol formation and known to regulate xylitol formation in pentose fermenting yeasts as it represses the synthesis of xylose reductase (Kastener et al. 2001) the main enzyme responsible for xylose-to-xylitol reduction.\n\nAs can be observed in Fig. 3a, b, C. tropicalis cells immobilized in sodium alginate beads were able to convert xylose to xylitol during the fermentation in shake flask, consuming around 98 % xylose and accumulating 41 g/L xylitol after 96 h. The values of xylitol yield (0.73 g/g) and volumetric productivity (0.43 g/L/h) obtained in the present work (Table 2) is better than most of the similar studies based on corn cob hydrolysate (Wang et al. 2009; Cheng et al. 2009; Bibbins et al. 2013). El-Batal and Khalaf (2004), reported higher xylitol titer (48 g/L) than the present work. However, the yield was low and the hydrolysate was detoxified prior to fermentation. Production of xylitol with corn cob hydrolysate is usually less as compared to rice straw hydrolysate (Table 3).Table 2 Results of xylose-to-xylitol bioconversion by C. tropicalis cells immobilized in calcium alginate beads after 96 h of cultivation in medium based on corn cob hemicellulosic hydrolysate\n\nPercentage of xylose consumption (%)\t98\t\nFinal xylitol concentration (g/L)\t41\t\nYield of xylitol on consumed xylose (g/g)\t0.73\t\nXylitol productivity (g/L/h)\t0.43\t\nTable 3 Comparison with other Candida sp. and yeast fermentation performance\n\nMicroorganism\tFeedstock/Method of detoxification\tXylitol production\t\nConcentration (g/L)\tYield (g/g)\tProductivity (g/L/h)\tReferences\t\n\nC. tropicalis in Poly urethane foam\tCorn cob hydrolysate, detoxification with lime\t–\t0.66\t1.90\tWang et al.

Same phenomenon was reported by other authors also (Yahashi et al. 1996) Acetic acid level at the beginning of this fermentation (4.6 g/L) was decreased to 2.4 g/L at the 96 h of fermentation. Overall acetic acid was not consumed as initial concentration was more than 2 g/L. Morita and Silva (2000), reported that at acetic acid concentration (>1.0 g/L), part of acid continues to be directed towards the Krebs cycle and the remainder may be utilized by another energy consuming metabolic pathway (Morita and Silva 2000). Cheng et al. (2009) studied the effect of glucose and acetic acid in the corn cob hydrolysate on xylitol production with C. tropicalis, Biomass growth favored by glucose but acetic acid at high concentration (>2 g/L) was inhibitory. Hence this strain was found to be more efficient to consume acetic acid (Cheng et al. 2009).\n\nCell growth was considered as the increase of the free cells concentration (Xf) in the fermentation medium and of immobilized cells in the gel beads (Xi). Figure 3c shows that the final concentration of free cell and the immobilized cell concentration at every periodic hours. Immobilized cell concentration decreased up to 24 h and then increased up to 48 h and remained almost constant until the end of the fermentation. Free cell concentration, which shows around 50–60 % of the total biomass at the end of the fermentation. This result suggests that the pores of the gel matrix were saturated by immobilized cells after this short time. A portion of these cells was released from the beads and proliferated in the medium; reaching a maximum concentration of 95 × 106 cells/mL. Similar results were obtained by other researchers also (Bibbins et al. 2013).\n\nHence, the studied fermentation occurred due to both free cells and immobilized cells, since a fraction of cells was freely suspended in the medium and another one was entrapped in the beads. The coexistence of mixed cultures consisting and free and immobilized cells is also described by several authors working on different immobilization systems (Bibbins et al. 2013; El-Batal and Khalaf 2004). This phenomenon might be due to two factors mainly cell leakage from the immobilized beads due to the shearing forces during agitation and the preferential growth of free cells generated from the surface of bead due to favorable substrate and medium conditions. Liouni et al. (2008), attributed the ability of cells located on the periphery of single cells to multiply and released into suspension as free cells. After 72 h of fermentation, free cells concentration maintained almost constant, probably due to oxygen limitation conditions created either by high biomass level or oxygen depletion in the broth. After this period, xylitol accumulated in the medium and reached its maximum concentration (41 g/L) at the end of the run.\n\nTill now, several research studies have been done with hemicellulosic acid hydrolysate from various lignocellulosic materials for xylitol production. A summary of these results are listed in Table 3. A number of previous studies focus only on detoxification of hydrolysate either by over liming (Wang et al. 2009) or combination with other detoxification method such as activated charcoal (Cheng et al. 2009, Liaw et al. 2008) or ion exchange (Carvalho et al. 2004, Gyan et al. 2011) to improve fermentation performance. Detoxification helps to remove toxic inhibitors like phenolics, furfural and 5-hydroxy methyl furfural (HMF). However, detoxification resulted into 5–10 % loss of sugar which adds to process cost. Only few studies have focused on fermenting hydrolysate without detoxification (Huang et al. 2011; Misra et al. 2013; Ping et al. 2013). In the relevant literature collected, the type of the hydrolysate discussed in the studies of converting xylose into xylitol by microorganisms include corn cob, corn fiber, sugarcane bagasse, hardwood, eucalyptus, rice straw, etc. Among which there is a large difference in relevant xylitol yield. The maximum yield from these studies varies widely from 0.40 to 0.73 g/g and productivity from 0.24 to 1.92 g/L/h.\n\nBibbins et al. (2013), obtained, fermentation of Debaromyces hansenii immobilized in calcium alginate beads in non-detoxified corn cob hydrolysate, resulted into 12.9 g/L of xylitol, 0.53 g/g yield and 0.23 g/L/h productivity in shake flask with use of synthetic nutrients and Misra et al. (2013), studied scale up in the 10 L reactor with working volume of 5 L of corn cob hemicellulosic hydrolysate without detoxification and adapted C. tropicalis cells to yield product titer of 11.89 g/L of xylitol, yield of 0.58 g/g, volume productivity 0.28 g/L/h and efficiency of 63.73 %. Kwon et al. (2006) used cell recycle fermentation using hollow fiber membrane to get xylitol productivity of 4.14 g/L/h and 0.82 g/g yield with synthetic pure xylose and Kim et al. (2004) produced xylitol from xylose by cell recycle fermentation of C. tropicalis using chemically defined medium to get 5.4 g/L/h productivity and 0.81 g/g yield. Whereas in this study yield, productivity and xylitol titer of 0.73 (theoretically 0.80) g/g, 0.43 g/L/h, 42 g/L were obtained, respectively from corn cob hydrolysate (hydrolysate contained 55–60 g/L xylose, 4.6 g/L acetic acid, 0.30 g/L of furfural and 0.20 g/L of 5-HMF) without any detoxification of hydrolysate or purification of xylose.\n\nReuse of immobilized cells\nCandida tropicalis cells were immobilized in Ca-alginate matrix as described in “Materials and methods”. Immobilized cells were used as inoculums for recycling batches. Such reuse was performed five times without impairment in the bioconversion rates and yields. The immobilized yeast produced xylitol with an average productivity of 0.32 g/L/h and theoretical conversion efficiency of 92 % for five successive batches (Fig. 4). The possibility of producing xylitol with Ca-alginate entrapped cells in synthetic xylose solutions (Misra et al. 2013; Carvalho et al. 2003) and in lignocellulosic hydrolysate (Misra et al. 2013) has been previously demonstrated.Fig. 4 Repeated batch xylose-to-xylitol bioconversion with cell recycling (initial xylose: 52 g/L; temp: 30 °C, agitation: 150 rpm)\n\n\n\nCandia tropicalis NCIM 3123 used in this study showed good potential for xylitol production in producing good xylitol yield and concentration in non-detoxified hydrolysate. More importantly, there was no breakage or disruption of calcium alginate beads in fermentation, so such cells of C. tropicalis immobilized in calcium alginate showed high stability and high performance for xylitol production from corn cob hemicellulosic hydrolysate. The preliminary study presented here demonstrate that the potential of high inhibitor tolerance of C. tropicalis NCIM 3123 when utilized with non-detoxified hydrolysate. In the future optimization of fermentation condition and media optimization for the yeast needs to be investigated.\n\nConclusions\nIndustrially feasible process for production of xylitol from non-detoxified hydrolysate with use of entrapped C. tropicalis is demonstrated. C. tropicalis cells were successfully immobilized in calcium alginate using the freezing–thawing method using a 23 full factorial design. More than 99.50 % immobilization efficiency obtained with beads maintaining size, shape in hydrolysate without any visible wearing. The results obtained in terms of the yield of xylitol on consumed xylose, xylitol volumetric productivity, and immobilization efficiency suggested a sodium alginate concentration of 20 g/L, calcium chloride concentration of 10 g/L and 4 numbers of freezing–thawing cycles at freezing temperature of −20 °C as the most optimized conditions for pellet preparation. Reused immobilized biomass showed sustained xylitol production even after 5 cycles. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed immobilization system to be used in future industrial xylose-to-xylitol production from low cost hemicellulosic hydrolysate.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOCX 26 kb)\n\n \n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the analytical team for their support in analyzing the samples and Siddhartha Pal for providing hemicellulosic hydrolysate stream.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest on publication of this article.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nBär A   O’Breen Nabors L  Gelardi RC   Xylitol Alternative sweeteners 1991 2 New York Marcel Deckker 341 379 \nBibbins BP  Salgado JM  Torrado A  Uscanga MGA  Domínguez JM   Culture parameters affecting xylitol production by Debaryomyces hansenii  immobilized in alginate beads Process Biochem 2013 48 387 397 10.1016/j.procbio.2013.01.006 \nBox GEP  Hunder WG  Hunter JS   Statistics for experiments 1978 1 NY Wiley \nCarvalho W  Silva SS  Santos JC  Converti A   Xylitol production by Ca alginate entrapped cells: comparison of different fermentation systems Enzyme Microb Technol 2003 32 553 559 10.1016/S0141-0229(03)00007-3 \nCarvalho W  Canilha L  Mussatto SI  Dragone G  Morales MLV  Solenzal AIN   Detoxification of sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic hydrolysate with ion-exchange resins for xylitol production by calcium alginate-entrapped cells J Chem Technol Biotechnol 2004 79 863 868 10.1002/jctb.1061 \nCarvalho W  Santos JC  Canhila L  Silva SS  Pergo P  Converti A   Xylitol production from SCB hydrolysate: metabolic behaviour of Candida guillermondii  cells entrapped in a Calcium alginate Biochem Eng J 2005 25 25 31 10.1016/j.bej.2005.03.006 \nChampagne CP  Blahuta N  Brion F  Gagnon C   A vortex-bowl disk atomizer system for the production of alginate beads in a 1500-liter fermentor Biotechnol Bioeng 2000 68 681 688 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(20000620)68:6<681::AID-BIT12>3.0.CO;2-L 10799994 \nChen XH  Wang XT  Lou WY  Wu YH  Zong MH  Smith TJ  Chen XD   Immobilization of Acetobacter  sp.

To elucidate, the genetic basis of resistance, a mapping population of recombinant inbred lines was developed from a cross between resistant Cappelle–Desprez and susceptible cultivar PBW343 using single-seed descent. Variety PBW343 had been one of the most popular cultivars of North Western Plains Zone, for more than a decade, before succumbing to the stripe rust. Cappelle–Desprez, a source of durable adult plant resistance, has maintained its resistance against stripe rust for a long time in Europe. Map construction and QTL analysis were completed with 1012 polymorphic (DArT and SSR) markers. Screenings for stripe rust disease were carried out in field condition for two consecutive crop seasons (2012–2013 and 2013–2014). Susceptible parent (PBW343) achieved a significant level of disease i.e., 100 % in both the years. In present investigations, resistance in Cappelle–Desprez was found stable and response to the rust ranged from 0 to 1.5 % over the years. The estimated broad-sense heritability (h2) of stripe rust rAUDPC in the mapping population was 0.82. The relative area under the disease progress curve data showed continuous distributions, indicating that trait was controlled multigenically. Genomic region identified on chromosome 2D, was located within the short arm, with flanking markers (Xgwm484–Xcfd73), explained phenotypic variation (PVE) ranged from 13.9 to 31.8 %. The genomic region identified on chromosome 5B was found with the effect of maximum contribution with flanking DArT markers (1376633|F|0–1207571|F|0), PVE ranged from 24 to 27.0 %. This can, therefore, be utilized for marker assisted selection in developing much needed stripe rust resistant lines for the northern wheat belt of India.\n\nKeywords\nStripe rustQTL mappingAdult plant resistanceDArT markersIndian Institute of Wheat & Barley Research KarnalDWR/RP/10-5.1Tiwari Ratan issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nStripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis is one of the major biotic constraints of wheat production in areas where the cool temperature prevails and affects the grain yield, quality and nutrition. Stripe rust is one of the most important diseases that can cause tremendous losses in wheat production worldwide (Stubbs 1988). Stripe rust can cause yield losses up to 10–70 % and in some cases as high as 100 % yield loss, if the infection occurs at a very early stage and continues to the later stage of the plants (Syed et al. 2007). Major wheat producing area in India fall under North Western Plains Zone (NWPZ) along with the strategic area of wheat cultivation under Northern Hills Zone (NHZ). The disease can be controlled by the use of chemicals, although this method is neither cost effective nor environmentally safe (Rosewarne et al. 2013). Other important effective strategy to control disease is the use of resistant cultivars and the deployment of resistance gene in high yielding varieties. Resistance could be either race specific or non-race specific. Race-specific, also called vertical/seedling/non-durable type of resistances often when deployed is effective only for short-time period (4–5 years). Generally, it is overcome by the new races of pathogen because of constant evolution/selection of races in the nature. On the other hand, non-race-specific resistance (horizontal/partial/slow-rusting/durable or adult plant resistances) shows pleiotropic effect is hard to match by the pathogen and can combat the disease for wide range of pathotypes. A number of such type of slow-rusting genes (showing additive effect) need to be pyramided together to achieve effective genetic control against disease progress in the field. Some of the durable/slow-rusting genes namely Lr34/Yr18, Lr46/Yr29, Lr67/Yr46 and Sr2/Yr30 have been reported and found effective in providing rust resistance at field level (Rosewarne et al. 2012). Therefore, it is necessary to search for new source(s) of resistance to identify durable adult plant effective stripe rust resistance against the evolving pathotypes in bread wheat.\n\nVarious molecular markers have been widely used to tag and map resistance genes in wheat; however, simple sequence repeat (SSR) has emerged as the choice of marker in gene mapping studies. The development of GBS molecular marker technology that leads to an easy genotyping of large complex genome size such as wheat results in production of detailed genetic map. High throughput markers are not well integrated into the maps, which is the major problem regarding its usage. So, with the help of SSR markers it is easy to locate the positions of different marker types (SNP and DArT) and can build consensus maps between different marker systems. Numerous QTLs (over 140) for resistance to stripe rust in wheat have been reported and through mapping of flanking markers on consensus maps, 49 chromosomal regions have been identified (Rosewarne et al. 2013).\n\nCappelle–Desprez (European cultivar) was first released in France in 1946 (Lupton and Macer 1962; Worland and Law 1986; Bonjean et al. 2001). It contains seedling resistance genes Yr3a and Yr4a (De Vallavieille-Pope et al. 1990), but presence of APR against stripe rust in this cultivar is less reported. Cappelle–Desprez maintained a high level of resistance so that it is still recognized as a good source of APR in many European countries.\n\nThe objective of the present study was to identify genomic regions controlling adult plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust in recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from the cross of ‘Cappelle–Desprez’ (resistant) with ‘PBW343’ (susceptible) parents.\n\nMethods\nDevelopment and evaluation of RILs\nThis work was conducted at the Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research (IIWBR), Karnal (29°41′0″N, 76°59′0″E) during the two consecutive crop seasons 2012–2013 and 2013–2014, under field condition. A mapping population of 88 F9 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between resistant Cappelle–Desprez (Vilmorin-27/Hybride-du-Joncquois) and susceptible cultivar PBW343 (ND/VG9144//KALBB/3/YCO “S”/4A/EE#S “S”) using single-seed descend method. The population was further advanced up to F9 generations through selfing.\n\nStripe rust response test\nAdult plant stripe rust response test\nPlanting was done in the first week of November in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with two replications. About 20 seeds from each line were planted in 1 m row with 20 cm space, comprising two rows in each replication. Susceptible check wheat variety ‘Agra local’ was planted after every 9th plot to ascertain the uniformity of infection throughout the field. Urediniospore-water-tween 20 suspension with stripe rust pathotype 46S119 was atomized at Z12–Z14 Zadok secondary growth stage (Zadoks et al. 1974) according to the National Plant protection Standard (Li et al. 1989). Urediniospores were collected from the actively sporulating plants of susceptible varieties maintained in isolation in polyhouse. Disease severity (DS) data were recorded at weekly interval, for four observations. The disease severity for each line was evaluated for the crop season 2012–2014, under field condition according to the modified Cob Scale (Peterson et al. 1948).\n\nMolecular marker analysis\nGenomic DNA was isolated from leaf sample at two leaf stage using DArT protocol (https://www.diversityarrays.com). Genotyping was done on 88 lines, including the parents with 26, 206 Diversity Array Technologies (DArT) markers by Triticarte Pty Ltd. (Canberra, Australia) and 50 SSR markers located specifically on chromosome 2D and 5B chromosomes (Appels 2003). A total of 1012 (962 DArT and 50 SSR) markers found polymorphic between the parents were used to find the linkage groups. The PCR was done on a thermocycler (BioRad, USA S-1000) with protocol consisting of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min; annealing at 50–60 °C (depending on the individual microsatellite primer) for 1 min; and extension at 72 °C for 1 min followed by a 6 min final extension at 72 °C. Amplification products were resolved by electrophoresis on 3 % agarose gels, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and gel photograph taken by Geldoc system (Syngene Ltd., USA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDisease severity data were used to calculate the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) for each line and the parent according to the formula, AUDPC=∑Yi+Y(i+1)2t(i+1)-ti, where Yi = disease severity value on date ti, t(i+1) − ti = time (days) between two disease scores n = number of times when disease was recorded (Duveiller et al. 1998; Joshi and Chand 2002). The relative AUDPC values were used for the subsequent analysis of variance (ANOVA) and QTL analysis (Lin and Chen 2007). ANOVA was performed using the SAS® 9.3 statistical package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\n\nBroad-sense heretability (h2) of phenotypic trait (rAUDPC) was calculated using the formula h2=σG2/σG2+σGE2/e+σE2/(e×r), where σG2,σGE2 and σE2 are estimates of genotypic, genotypic × environment interaction and error variances, respectively, and e and r are the numbers of environments and replications per environment, respectively (Yang et al. 2005).\n\nChi test for goodness-of-fit to the expected 1:1 was analyzed for the segregation of individual markers. Polymorphic marker loci exhibiting significant distortion from these expected 1:1 segregation ratios were discarded from the linkage analysis. Chi-square analysis of observed against expected frequencies for disease severity classes was calculated with the “Chi test” function in Microsoft office 2007 Excel. χ2 = ∑ (Observed value − Expected value)2/(Expected value), where degree of freedom (df) = n − 1.\n\nGenetic linkage groups were performed using “MapDisto” Version 1.7 beta software (http://mapdisto.free.fr; Lorieux 2007). Further, grouped markers position was estimated using Join map 4.1 (Van Ooijen 2006). QTL analysis was performed using polymorphic markers falling in a particular linkage group and rAUDPC of the RIL population using composite interval mapping (CIM) with WinQTL Cart V2.5 (Wang et al. 2011). For CIM, significant logarithm of odds (LOD) thresholds was estimated by conducting a permutation test with 1000 interactions at P = 0.05 (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Composite interval mapping of stripe rust severity at adult plant stage in the Cappelle–Desprez/PBW343 mapping population based on stripe rust screening for 2014 and 2013. QTLs were detected on chromosome 2D (a) and 5B (b) with significant LOD scores\n\n\n\nResults\nField assessment of stripe rust resistance\nThe field studies showed a significance level of disease within the population in both the years (Table 2). Stripe rust severity for the susceptible parent was 100 %; the resistance in Cappelle–Desprez was stable across the years and response to the rust ranged from 0 to 1.5 % over the years. Relative area under disease progress curve (rAUDPC) was calculated from the stripe rust scoring for both crop seasons. No significant differences were detected among replications; and RILs were the only significant source of phenotypic variation observed in the study and interaction between genotype × year was significant; therefore, ANOVA was performed separately for both the years (Table 3). Relative AUDPC during 2012–2013 ranged from 0 to 116.5 with an average of 46.1. For the year 2013–2014, the range of rAUDPC was 1.5–98.5 and mean value was 39.1. The value of standard error (SE) was obtained as 1.0 at 5 % LSD value as shown in Table 2. The estimated broad-sense heritability (h2) of stripe rust rAUDPC in the mapping population was 0.82. Phenotypic classification for both the years (2012–2013 and 2013–2014) showing transgressive segregation has been given in the Fig. 2a, b.Fig. 2 Frequency distribution of relative area under the disease progress curve (rAUDPC) for 88 F9 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for adult plant resistance to stripe rust for year 2013 and 2014\n\n\n\nMapping and QTL analysis\nA genetic linkage map was constructed using 50 SSR (18.8 %) along with 962 (3.6 %) polymorphic markers between parents Cappelle–Desprez and PBW343. Twenty-six linkage groups were identified which covered almost all the 21 chromosomes of Wheat. Identified these two groups representing chromosome 2D and 5B containing at least 2 or more SSR loci’s on each. Linkage groups 2D and 5B covered a total map distance of 248 cM.\n\nLinkage groups 2D and 5B containing a total of 11 SSR and 2 SSR + 12 DArT markers covered a map distance of 95 and 153 cM, respectively. Identified two linkage groups were used for QTL analysis using rAUDPC data. QTL mapping using CIM method of WinQTL Cart V2.5 was detected QTL for adult plant stripe rust response variation on chromosome 2D and 5B. A LOD score 2.5 was considered as a significant value to detect a QTL.\n\nSubsequent QTL analysis in the mapping population ‘Cappelle–Desprez × PBW343’ led to the identification of two QTLs (QYr.iiwbr-5B and QYr.iiwbr-2D) was detected separately and also with mean values of rAUDPC for both the years i.e., 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 (Table 1). The LOD value of rAUDPC for the above years ranged from 3.0 to 3.8 & 3.5 to 6.0, respectively while their corresponding phenotypic variation (PVE) ranged from 13.9 to 31.8 and 24.0 to 27.0 %, respectively. QYr.iiwbr-5B conferring with maximum contribution to stripe rust resistance was flanked by DArT markers 1376633|F|0–1207571|F|0 peaks located with XWmc745 marker. A minor QTLeffect showed on the short arm of chromosome 2D (QYr.iiwbr-2D) to stripe rust with flanking marker loci Xgwm484–Xcfd73. The stripe rust resistance QTLs mapped, their chromosomal location, flanking markers and explained phenotypic variance (PVE) based on composite interval mapping is summarized in Table 1.Table 1 Identification of significant (LOD > 2.5) QTL for stripe rust resistance, their chromosomal location, flanking markers and explained phenotypic variance (R\n2) based on composite interval mapping in Cappelle–Desprez × PBW 343 population\n\nYear\tQTL\tMarker interval\tLOD\tInterval size (cM)\tPVE (%)\tAdd\t\n2013\t\nQYr.iiwbr-5B\n\t1376633|F|0–1207571|F|0\t3.8\t26.4\t31.8\t16.6\t\n\nQYr.iiwbr-2D\n\t\nXgwm484–Xcfd73\n\t3.0\t34.7\t13.9\t12.7\t\n2014\t\nQYr.iiwbr-5B\n\t1376633|F|0–1207571|F|0\t6.0\t26.4\t27.0\t17.0\t\n\nQYr.iiwbr-2D\n\t\nXgwm484–Xcfd73\n\t3.5\t34.7\t24.0\t7.0\t\nAverage\t\nQYr.iiwbr-5B\n\t1376633|F|0–1207571|F|0\t8.0\t26.4\t34.1\t20.2\t\n\nQYr.iiwbr-2D\n\t\nXgwm484–Xcfd73\n\t2.6\t34.7\t20.1\t8.9\t\n\n\nAdult plant effective genomic regions for stripe rust were identified during the present study. Chromosome 2D and 5B carried genes which were found effective for stripe rust pathotype prevalent under the field conditions. These genomic regions were found to be effective for Indian isolates of stripe rust. These genomic regions identified in the present study can be exploited for enhancing the stripe rust resistance in the wheat cultivars through marker assisted selection (Tables 2, 3).Table 2 Range, mean, 5 % LSD and standard error for trait stripe rust in the population\n\nTrait\tYear\tRange\tMean\t5 % LSD\tError\t\nAUDPC\t2013\t0–116.5\t46.1\t2.8\t1.0\t\n2014\t1.5–98.5\t39.1\t\nTable 3 Variance components of relative area under the disease progress curve of the F9 recombinant inbred line population derived from Cappelle–Desprez/PBW343\n\nSource of variation\t\ndf\n\tMean square\t\nF value\t\nP > F\n\t\n2014\t\n Gen\t87\t919.01679\t12.17\t<0.0001\t\n Rep\t1\t9.33889\t0.12\t0.7260NS\n\t\n Error\t\t75.54114\t\t\t\n2013\t\n Gen\t87\t1975.7017\t780.71\t<0.0001\t\n Rep\t1\t0.2722\t0.11\t0.7437NS\n\t\n Error\t\t2.5306\t\t\t\n\n\nDiscussion\nStripe rust severity for the susceptible parent (PBW343) achieved a significant level of disease i.e., 100 % in both the years. In India, PBW343 had been one of the most popular and ruling varieties of North Western Plains Zone (NWPZ). Lines PBW343 and Inqualab 91 along with their derivatives not only carried high levels of resistance to leaf and stripe rusts or both, but also showed about 5–15 % higher yield potential than the original cultivars (Singh et al. 2004). Stripe rust resistance in PBW343 (in India), Inquilab-91 and Bakhtwar (in Pakistan), Chamran and Shiroudi (in Iran), Kubsa (in Ethiopia) and Cham 8 (in Syria) was based on Yr27. Breakdown of Yr27 resistance in PBW343, Inquilab 91 and Chamran, in India, Pakistan and Iran, respectively, was reported between 2002 and 2004. Although occasional stripe rust outbreaks appeared in some other wheat growing areas of the world as well but due to unfavorable environmental conditions increase in the severity of Yr27 virulent pathotypes got restricted.\n\nIn present investigation resistance in Cappelle–Desprez was found stable and response to the rust ranged from 0 to 1.5 % over the years. Cappelle–Desprez (European cultivar) was first released in France and due to its resistance to stripe rust it occupied a large acreage across Western Europe for a very long duration, until the late 1970s (Bonjean et al. 2001). Worland and Law (1986) and Law and Worland (1997) reported high level of APR for number of major diseases, including stripe rust as a main reason of longevity of this cultivar. Due to the longevity of this cultivar, it was extensively used in many breeding programmes such as UK and in many European countries (Angus 2001; Bonjean et al. 2001; Porche 2001). Cappelle–Desprez although known for having seedling resistance genes Yr3a and Yr4a (De Vallavieille-Pope et al. 1990), also maintained a high level of resistance in many European countries due to its adult plant resistance.\n\nPresent study leads to the identification of QYr.iiwbr-5B on short arm of chromosome 5B with flanking DArT markers (1376633|F|0–1207571|F|0), peak located with XWmc745 marker explaining 34.1 % phenotypic variation with mean rAUDPC value. Mallard et al. (2005) identified two QTL (QYr. inra-5B.1 and QYr. inra-5B.2) with SSR loci Xgwm544 in Camp Remy which mapped to the telomeric region on the long arm of chromosome 5B.\n\nRiley et al. (1967) and Badaeva et al. (2007) reported that Cappelle–Desprez carries the reciprocal, centromeric translocations 5BL–7BL and 5BS–7BS. Its parentage (vilmorin and Hybride du Joncquois) also possesses this translocation (Worland and Law 1986; Law and Worland 1997). Boukhatem et al. (2002), however, in their study, did not identify any QTL on chromosome 5B in Camp Remy. Stripe rust resistance QTL on chromosome 5B have also been detected in the Italian cvs Libellula and Strampelli (Lu et al. 2009), the Israeli cv. Oligoculm (Suenaga et al. 2003), the Australian cv. Janz (Bariana et al. 2010) and the French cv. Flinor (Feng et al. 2011). Feng et al. (2011) identified two QTLs on chromosome 5B which are expressed at the seedling stage and at higher temperatures (QYr-tem-5B.1 and QYr-tem-5B.2) in Flinor. Flinor has ancestral relationship with Cappelle–Desprez and one of these QTL, QYr-tem-5B.1, overlaps with the region defining QYr.ufs-5B. QYr-tem-5B.1 explained up to 33 % of the phenotypic variation in Flinor.\n\nPresent investigation, also, mapped a minor QTL region on chromosome 2D with significant LOD value. QYr.iiwbr-2D, although defined by a smaller marker interval with flanking SSR markers (Xgwm102–Xcfd73), was found contributing less significantly to the explained phenotypic variance i.e., 20.1 % with rAUDPC mean value of both the years. Mallard et al. (2005) identified a QTL (QYr.inra-2DS) near to the centromere on 2DS in the cv. Camp Rémy between marker loci Xgwm102 and Xgwm539 explaining 24–69 % phenotypic variance, although the reason for explained low phenotypic variance may be probably due to differences in environmental conditions or influenced by genetic background.\n\nWorland and Law (1986) and Worland et al. (1988) suggested that Yr16, gene is located on the centromeric region of chromosome 2D and this was further confirmed through cytogenetic analysis. Devos et al. (1993) and Agenbag et al. (2012) placed the gene 9.3 cM from the centromere between RFLP marker loci Xpsr641-2D and Xpsr681-2D on a consensus map, Ta-Gale-2D (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml).\n\nBariana et al. (2001) reported temperature-sensitive seedling resistance, YrCK on chromosome 2D in the Australian cv. Cook and a derivative, cv. Sunco explaining 13–19 % of the phenotypic variance for stripe rust and 9–13 % of the phenotypic variance for leaf rust resistance (Navabi et al. 2005). QYr.caas-2DS, explaining 8.4–12.1 % of the phenotypic variance, was identified in the Italian cv. Libellula, (Lu et al. 2009), while Suenaga et al. (2003) detected QTL explaining less than 10 % of the phenotypic variance in the cv. Oligoculm in this region on 2DS. Stripe rust resistance QTL were identified and mapped on the short arm of chromosome 2D, close to the QYr.ufs-2D in the UK cvs Guardian (Melichar et al. 2008) and Claire (Powell 2010), both of which have Cappelle–Desprez in their pedigrees.\n\nPresent investigation confirms the effectiveness of genomic regions on chromosome 2D and 5B for stripe rust pathotypes in our population in Indian conditions. These may be exploited for enhancing the level of resistance against stripe rust in the cultivated wheat germplasm through marker assisted selection.\n\nThis is an outcome of the Project DWR/RP/10-5.1.

This need drove the research towards the synthesis of nanoscale antimicrobial compounds. We, therefore, screened several bacteria for the biosynthesis of copper/copper compound nanoparticles which could inhibit the growth of Desulfovibrio marinisediminis, a sulfate reducing bacterium. Supernatant of thirty bacteria isolated from the biofilm formed on ship hull was mixed with 1 mM CuCl2 solution at room temperature. Eight bacterial strains, whose mixtures exhibited colour change, were selected for antimicrobial test. One nanoparticle which has been biosynthesized by Shewanella indica inhibited the growth of D. marinisediminis. Characterization of this particle by UV–visible spectrophotometer, XRD, TEM, DLS and FTIR showed that the particle is polydisperse CuO nanoparticle with average size of 400 nm.\n\nKeywords\nCorrosionSRBBiosynthesisNanoparticlesCopper oxideissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nPaint and coating industries get the benefit by the use of NP to reduce corrosion. Addition of NP modifies morphology, conductivity and different physical properties of coats and provides superior resistance against metal corrosion (Montemor 2014). Microorganisms have an important role in corrosion. They cause rapid and severe type of corrosion failure which is well documented by many industries including shipping industry, offshore oil and gas production, power plants and coastal industrial plants (Licina and Cubicciotti 1989; Bodtker et al. 2008; Inbakandan et al. 2010). To manage microbial corrosion, nano-scale materials such as nanosilver and nanotitanium dioxide with potent antimicrobial activity are used to inhibit the microbial growth (Yu et al. 2003; Naik and Kowshik 2014). Copper and copper oxides are other nanoparticles possessing high toxicity. Their toxic effect found to be due to generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and DNA degradation in the bacterial cells (Chatterjee et al. 2014).\n\nThese compounds have been synthesized by physical and chemical methods including thermal reduction, vacuum vapor deposition, microwave irradiation, chemical reduction, and laser ablation methods (Liu and Bando 2003; Zhao et al. 2004; Tilaki and Mahdavi 2007; Dang et al. 2011; Sohrabnezhad et al. 2014). In these methods, hazardous chemicals are being used for the synthesis of Cu and CuONP.\n\nA growing need for simple and viable alternative to toxic chemical and/or physical methods drives researcher to synthesize NP by environment-friendly techniques. There are many reports on antimicrobial activity of available biosynthesized nanoparticles (NP) and accessible bacteria rather than specific ones such as sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) (Demurtas and Perry 2014; Haider et al. 2014; Khatoon et al. 2015; Razi et al. 2015). SRB are anaerobic bacteria reducing sulfate to corrosive sulfide causing severe corrosion of metals. Many industries including maritime industries experience corrosion problems due to the presence of SRB (Wade et al. 2011). Since the antimicrobial activities of NP are dependent on the physiochemical properties of NP and type of bacteria, in the present study, we screened biosynthesized CuONP which have antimicrobial activity against Desulfovibrio marinisediminis GSR3, a corrosion causing bacteria isolated from the ship hull.\n\nMaterials and methods\nBacterial isolation and growth condition\nBacterial biofilm formed on corroded metal pieces from underwater hull of a fishing vessel in Goa, India, was harvested and used for the study. Each metal piece was\nwashed three times with sterile phosphate buffer solution to remove any loosely attached bacteria. The remaining sessile bacteria were scraped off with sterile scalpel and then transferred to 100 ml sterile glass container filled with Zobell marine broth 2216 (Himedia, India). The bottle was incubated at 27 °C for 48 h. After successful growth, bacterial colonies were purified and subcultured in Luria–bertani broth for further investigation. D. marinisediminis GSR3 (KR303707) isolated from the same ship hull was used as test microorganism. This bacterium was cultivated in 15 ml screw cap tube containing Postgate’s B medium (5 ml 70 % sodium lactate, 0.5 g KH2PO4, 1.0 g NH4Cl, 1.0 g Na2SO4, 2.0 g MgSO4·7H2O, 1.0 g yeast extract, 0.1 g CaCl2·2H2O, 0.5 g FeSO4·7H2O and 20 g NaCl in 1L of distilled water) (pH 7.5–8.0) and sodium thioglycolate (0.1 g) and vitamin C (0.1 g) as reducing agents.\n\nBiosynthesis of nanoparticles\nThe isolated bacteria were inoculated in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of Zobell marine broth and incubated for 48 h at 27 °C. After incubation, the cell-free supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min. About 40 ml of the supernatant was added to the 250 ml conical flask containing 40 ml CuCl2 solution (1 mM). The flasks were incubated at 27 °C. When the solution colour changed to yellowish-brown, the synthesized NP were isolated by centrifugation and repeated washing with sterile distilled water to remove the salt. Sterile Zobell marine broth mixed with CuCl2 was used as negative control.\n\nDetermination of antimicrobial activity of biosynthesized NP\nTo determine the antimicrobial activity of biosynthesized NP on SRB, a density of bacteria equal to 0.5 Mcfarland was used to test the susceptibility. The aliquots (450 μl) were dispensed in sterile microcentrifuge tubes and 50 μl of NP extracts was added. Microcentrifuge tubes were incubated anaerobically for 2 h at 27 °C. To check the effectiveness of treatment, bacterial numbers were enumerated by drop plate method (Chen et al. 2003). Polymyxin B (100 μg/ml) was used as a positive control. S. indica supernatant and SRB culture without any treatment were used as negative control.\n\nDetermination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\nMinimum inhibitory concentration of CuONP was determined by the broth microdilution method. Twofold serial dilutions of nanoparticles were prepared with sterile Postagte’s B broth. The dilutions were prepared at concentration equal to twice the desired final concentration. Further, 100 μl of NP solution was transferred into each well of 96-well plate and 100 μl culture of the test bacteria was inoculated to the wells to obtain the total volume of 200 μl. The final concentration of nanoparticles in the wells ranged from 0.7 to 200 μg/ml. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation at 27 °C, MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of nanoparticles which did not allow blackening of the medium.\n\nCharacterization of NP\nBioreduction of copper ions in aqueous solution was initially monitored by visual observation. Further, to confirm the biosynthesis of CuONP, characterization was done by UV–Vis spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, DLS and FTIR. UV–visible spectroscopy analysis of colloidal CuONP was carried out on Multiskan Spectrum spectrophotometer (Thermo scientific, Germany) at the wavelength range of 300–700 nm. Powder XRD patterns were recorded on RigakuminiFlex 11 diffractometer at 30 kV, 15 mA for Cu Ka radiation (k = 1.5406 A°) with a 2θ scanning range of 6–80° at 5 min−1. Dynamic Light Scattering (Zetasizer, Malvern) was used to determine the size distribution of particles in the colloidal solution. The morphology, dispersity and of CuONP were studied by TEM analysis (Tecnai G2 spirit BioTWIN, 20–120 kv, Netherland). Sample for TEM studies was prepared by adding a drop of NP suspension onto a carbon coated 200 mesh copper grid and allowed to dry at room temperature prior to examination. Functional groups present in biosynthesized NP were analyzed by FTIR. Fine freeze-dried powder of CuONP were used for the analysis, and the FTIR spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer (FTIR, Jasco-460 plus) in the spectral region of 400–4000 cm−1 using a resolution of 4 cm−1.\n\nMolecular identification of screened bacteria\nBacteria which synthesized NP with inhibitory activity were identified by the use of 16S rRNA gene sequences. 16S rDNA locus was amplified by universal primer pairs, 27F and 1492 R (Lane 1991). The PCR condition included an initial denaturation of 94 °C for 7 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was sequenced by Sanger’s dideoxynucleotide sequencing method and the obtained sequence was submitted to the GenBank, NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information).\n\nResults and discussion\nIndustries use chemicals, mainly biocides to mitigate microbial corrosion. However, due to the emergence of bacterial resistance, they tend to look for alternative antimicrobial agents. Interest in the application of nano-sized antimicrobial compounds is on the increase. Nano-sized materials have higher antimicrobial properties as compared to the bulky ones because by decreasing the dimension of the compounds, the surface to volume ratio will get increased and this property augments their interaction with bacterial cell membrane (Hajipour et al. 2012). Though these compounds have good antimicrobial activity, they can be synthesized by Microorganism. Bacteria can very well be used as nanofactories. Biosynthesis of nanoparticles by microorganisms has been attributed to energy production, special functions and detoxification of heavy metals (Krumov et al. 2009). Ramanathan et al. (2013) hypothesised that Morganella sp., a silver-resistant bacterium with ability to biosynthesis silver NP, is able to produce copper NP because proteins responsible for bacterial resistant to silver and copper were highly similar. This bacterium was able to produce spherical copper/copper oxide NP with the size of 7–15 nm. Although there are some reports regarding the biosynthesis of copper and its oxide by Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas stutzeri, the exploitation of bacteria as biological resource material for synthesis of Copper NP needs further explorations (Singh et al. 2010; Varshney et al. 2010; Ramanathan et al. 2013). In the present study, we isolated bacteria from the biofilm (an environment where vast diversity of bacteria live in packed community) formed on corroded ship hull which was covered with paint containing copper. Initially, bacteria have been screened for the synthesis of nanoparticles. After adding bacterial supernatant with CuCl2 solution, colour change from light yellow to light brown was observed in eight mixtures. This colour change is the primary indicator for the synthesis of CuONP.\n\nAfter preliminary screening, the selected mixtures were used for antimicrobial test against D. marinisediminis. Among the eight mixtures, only one exhibits antimicrobial activity against SRB. Treatment of bacterial solution with CuONP reduced bacterial number from 9 × 106 CFU/ml (Number of bacteria in untreated sample) to 4 × 103 CFU/ml (Table 1). Minimum inhibitory concentration of NP, which is defined as the lowest concentration at which there is no blackening of media, was found to be 100 μg/ml concentration (Fig. 1).Table 1 Antimicrobial activity of CuONP against D. marinisediminis\n\n\n\tNumber of bacteria (CFU/ml)\t\nTest\t8 × 103\n\t\nPositive control\t3 × 105\n\t\nNegative control\t1\t9 × 106\n\t\n2\t2 × 106\n\t\n+, Polymyxin B; −, (1) No treatment (2) S. indica supernatant\n\nFig. 1 Minimum inhibitory concentration of biosynthesized CuONP against D. marinisediminis (wells NO. 1–10 contains 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.1, 1.5 and 0.75 μg/ml CuONP and wells NO. 11 and 12 are negative and positive control)\n\n\n\nCuONP has potent antimicrobial activity for various bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus Mutans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (Perelshtein et al. 2009; Azam et al. 2012; Padil and Cernik 2013; Ramazanzadeh et al. 2015). However, as it has been shown by studies, the antimicrobial activity of NP is shape and size dependent (Pal et al. 2007; Ajitha et al. 2015). Padil and Cernik (2013) studied the antimicrobial activity of 4 and 7 nm CuONP which has been synthesized by gum karaya. They observed better activity of smaller particle against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Since the other seven mixtures did not show any antimicrobial effect on D. marinisediminis, they have not been characterized; however, we considered that their failure to inhibit the bacteria is due to their inappropriate size or shape.\n\nMolecular characterization of strain responsible for synthesis of bioactive nanoparticles revealed that the isolate belonged to Shewanella indica subsp. GSR2 (accession number: KR303706) (Fig. 2). Shewanella can change the oxidation states of metals. The ability of Shewanella spp for the biosynthesis of NP; Palladium, gold and iron oxide has been proved previously (Konishi et al. 2007; Bose et al. 2009; De Corte et al. 2011). However, there is no earlier report regarding the ability of S. indica to biosynthesis copper or copper compound nanoparticle.Fig. 2 Phylogenetic tree of partial 16S rDNA obtained from Shewanella indica subsp. GSR2\n\n\n\nThe biosynthesized NP were characterized using UV–visible spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, DLS and FTIR. The basic characterization of compound by UV–visible spectroscopy showed formation of broad absorbance band around 399 nm which suggests the formation of CuONP (Khanehzaei et al. 2014) (Fig. 3). This result has been confirmed by XRD analysis. The diffraction peaks of sample positioned with 2θ value of 35.5, 38.7, 48.7, 58.1, 61.5, 65.9 were assigned to −110, 111, −202, 202, 113, 022 planes. These planes were matched with the value of crystal CuONP (JCPDS card no. 89-5895) (Fig. 4).Fig. 3 UV–visible spectra of CuO nanoparticles synthesized by supernatant of S. indica\n\n\nFig. 4 X-ray diffraction pattern of copper oxide nanoparticles synthesized by supernatant of S. indica\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of bioactive compound in bacterial supernatant has been proved by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 5). The spectral analysis revealed the presence of vibration bands at 1623, 1419, 1107, 613 and an intense broad band at 3251 cm−1. The band at 3251 cm−1 is due to hydroxyl functional groups (O–H stretching) of alcohol/phenol derivatives (Yugandhar and Savithramma 2015). The band at 1419 cm−1 corresponds to the carboxylic group and the band at 613 cm−1 is due to C–H stretching. The bands at 1623 and 1107 cm−1, respectively, correspond to the –N–H stretch and C–O–C stretch vibrations in amide linkages (amide I and amide II), indicating the involvement of protein/peptide in encapping the nanoparticles (Coates 2000; Salehizadeh et al. 2012). Formation of protein coating on the NP surface prevents agglomeration of metal NP and also helps in their stabilization. The TEM micrograph shown in Fig. 6 clearly demonstrates the formation of spherical particles with different sizes between 150 and 600 nm. In contribution with TEM results, the DLS analysis also showed the formation of polydispersed particles with average size of 400 nm (Fig. 7).Fig. 5 FTIR spectra of CuO nanoparticles synthesized from supernatant of S. indica\n\n\nFig. 6 TEM image of biosynthesized CuO nanoparticles\n\nFig. 7 Size distribution of CuO nanoparticles synthesized from supernatant of S. indic\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nUse of nano-antimicrobial compound to control biocorrosion is an attractive option for industry because of its high biocidal activity. These particles could be synthesized by physical, chemical and biological methods. As the biological method is eco-friendly, it has got profound interest compared to other methods. In the present study, extracellular synthesis of polydispersed CuONP with average size of 400 nm by S. indica strain has been reported. These NP have the ability to inhibit the growth of metal corrosion causing bacteria, D. marinisedimins. With our finding and earlier report on ability of Shewanella biofilm in inhibition of copper corrosion, it seems reasonable to protect copper from MIC by Shewanella live biofilm (Kusa et al. 2006). The advantage of this process as compared to adding nanoparticle to paint is that the nanoparticles do not leach out of biofilm and kill only those bacteria that contact the biofilm.\n\nAuthors wish to acknowledge the facilities provided by University Grants Commission, India, under the program of Centre with Potential for Excellence and University with Potential for Excellence.

It protects plants by triggering the defense system which restricts the pathogen growth. This is the first report on the isolation, purification and characterization of RGA2 from the stems of Tinospora cordifolia, a medicinal plant. The RGA2 was purified using simple two-step process using DEAE-Hi-Trap FF and Superdex 200 chromatography columns, with a high yield. The purity of RGA2 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and identified by MALDI-TOF/MS. The purified protein was further characterized for its secondary structural elements using the far-UV circular dichroism measurements. Our purification procedure is simple two-step process with high yield which can be further used to produce RGA2 for structural and functional studies.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-016-0400-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nTinospora cordifoliaChromatographyProtein purificationRho GTPase activating proteinMALDI-TOFhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843Science and Engineering Research Board (IN)issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nThe Rho GTPases activating protein 2 (RGA2), belonging to the superfamily of small G proteins, is found in both higher and lower eukaryotic organisms. These proteins are involved in diverse biological processes such as regulation of actin and microtubule cytoskeleton, cell cycle, vesicle trafficking, cell polarity, and gene expression (Bustelo et al. 2007; Cansado et al. 2010). Enzymatically it has GTPase activity which hydrolyzes the GTP to GDP and inorganic phosphate (Bourne et al. 1991). The activity of RGA2 is positively regulated by GDP-GTP exchange which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP to activate the switch. However, GTPase-activating proteins stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity to inactivate the switch and GDP dissociation inhibitors which block spontaneous activation, are considered as a negative regulators (Soto et al. 2010). These regulators are important for the specificity of Rho functions (Villar-Tajadura et al. 2008). These regulators actually modify the signaling activity of the GTPase (de Bettignies et al. 2001).\n\nThe plant-specific Rop subfamily of Rho GTPases is very similar to the mammalian Cdc42 and Rac GTPases (de Bettignies et al. 2001). These Rho GTPases play significant roles in the regulation of peroxide-mediated cell death, calcium-dependent pollen tube growth, and other processes in plants (Roumanie et al. 2001; Wu et al. 2000). RGA2 is also found in higher plants where it acts as a small GTPase-associated defensome system for plant immunity (Liu et al. 2015). Furthermore, Rho GTPase activating proteins play important roles in the developmental process (Ye et al. 2014).\n\nTinospora cordifolia is a well-known Indian medicinal plant and its extract posses immunomodulatory and anticancer activities (Bala et al. 2015) especially against epithelial cancer cells (Maliyakkal et al. 2015). RGA2 has been reported to be purified and characterized from different sources. Yang and Watson (1993) reported that cloning, expression and characterization of rho, a ras-related small GTP-binding protein from the garden pea. Matsuda et al. (1996) have partially purified a membrane-associated GDP/GTP exchange proteins from the crude synaptic membrane fraction of rat brain using a combination of column chromatographies. RGA2 has been purified from S. pombe which was shown to regulates Rho2-Pck2 interaction and might participates in the regulation of the MAPK cell integrity pathway (Villar-Tajadura et al. 2008). Recently we have purified oligonucleotide binding (OB)-fold protein (Amir et al. 2015a) and Ras-related protein, Rab5a (Amir et al. 2015b) from the stem of Tinospora cordifolia.\n\nIn this article we are for the first time reporting the purification and characterization of RGA2, a Rho2 GTPase activating proteins from Tinospora cordifolia. We used a simple chromatographic procedure to get this protein in plenty with high purity. We also performed structural analysis to establish a structure–function relationship.\n\nMaterials and methods\nMaterials\nTinospora cordifolia plant was obtained from Ch. Devi Lal Rudraksh Vatika Herbal Nature Park, Bhudkalan, Yamunanagar, Haryana, India. The bark of green stem was removed by scalpel blade and homogenized in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0 with 500 mM NaCl. All reagents of highest purity grade were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and GE Healthcare. Hi Trap DEAE FF and Superdex-200 columns were purchased from GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden. Electrophoresis reagents were purchased from the Bio-Rad Laboratories (Richmond, CA, USA). Databases used are http://www.matrixscience.com/, http://www.uniprot.org., http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi and http://cbdm-01.zdv.uni-mainz.de/~andrade/k2d2//.\n\nProtein isolation\nAll purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. 200 g of green stem of Tinospora cordifolia without bark was crushed with 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0 + 500 mM NaCl, and homogenized with blender in the ice-cold homogenization buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA), and 1 % polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), 4 ml of buffer contained one gram of wet tissue. The homogenate was cleared by filtration through two layers of cheese cloth and left for overnight stirring at 4 °C. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the homogenate to achieve 30 % saturation and kept for 12 h. Ammonium sulfate precipitate was removed after centrifugation at 12000g for 15 min. The supernatant thus obtained was further saturated to 60 % by ammonium sulfate and centrifuged at 12000g for 15 min. The supernatant obtained was further saturated to 90 % ammonium sulfate and centrifuged at 12000g for 15 min. The ammonium sulfate precipitate thus obtained was collected and dissolved in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 8.0 and was extensively dialyzed against the same buffer.\n\nIon-exchange chromatography\nThe dialyzed sample was loaded on Hi Trap DEAE FF (1 ml, 7 × 25 mm) column (GE Healthcare), pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Akta purifier (GE Healthcare) connected system to control the flow rate and fraction size of elution. The sample was injected into the column with 5 ml loop. The flow rate of 1 ml/min is maintained for both binding and elution. The column was washed with equilibration buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with NaCl linear gradient (0–1 M NaCl w/v) in the same buffer. The first peak obtained at 0.10 M of NaCl was pooled, concentrated using Amicon Ultra 3 K device (Merck Darmstadt, Germany).\n\nGel filtration chromatography\nConcentrated protein sample (1 ml) was injected on to the Superdex 200 column connected to the Akta purifier (GE Healthcare, USA). The column was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 8.0 at the rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution profile was analyzed by unicorn manager (version 5.0) for the absorbance at 280 nm against elution volume (ml).\n\nGel electrophoresis\nMolecular mass of the protein was determined by SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (Laemmli 1970). The SDS-PAGE was performed in a slab gel assembly using 12 % (w/v) acrylamide and 0.02 % (w/v) bisacrylamide in the separating gel and 5 % (w/v) acrylamide and 0.16 % (w/v) bisacrylamide in the stacking gel. The gel buffer was 0.375 M Tris–HCl, pH 8.8. The electrode buffer was 25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.3 containing 0.192 M glycine. Gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue G-250. Molecular mass standards (10–180 kDa) were used for the molecular mass determination.\n\nMass spectrometry\nThe band of RGA2 was excised from the SDS-PAGE and subjected for identification to the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) (Kratos analytical, shimadzu group company, japan) equipped with a 337 nm pulsed UV laser, a 1.7 m length flight tube and a curved field reflectron. A detail of MALDI-TOF procedure was described elsewhere (Dar et al. 2014; Hassan et al. 2007, 2008b). The observed mass spectra, peak areas versus mass/electric charge (m/z) of mono-isotopic ions were calculated with MASCOT distiller software version1.1.2.0 (Matrix Science, London, UK).\n\nCircular dichroism measurements\nCircular Dichroism (CD) spectra were measured in Jasco Spectropolarimeter (Model J-1500) equipped with peltier-type temperature controller (CDF-426S). The far-UV CD spectra (250–200 nm) were recorded at 25 ± 0.1 °C using a 1 mm path length cell, and the protein concentration used was 0.28 mg/ml. The samples were prepared in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer at pH 8.0. The raw CD data were converted to protein concentration independent parameter, the mean residue ellipticity, (θ)λ (deg cm2 dmol−1) using the relation, θλ=Moθλ/10lc where θλ is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, Mo is the mean residue weight of the protein, c is concentration in mg ml−1, and l is the path length of the cell in cm.\n\nResults and discussion\nThe root, stem, and leaves of Tinospora cordifolia are used in Ayurvedic medicine (Upadhyay et al. 2010). Phytochemicals present in the Tinospora cordifolia are used for the treatment of diabetes, high cholesterol, gout, allergic rhinitis, lymphoma and other cancers, upset stomach, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, gonorrhea, syphilis, peptic ulcer disease, fever, and to boost the immune system (Saha and Ghosh 2012). Apart from several phytochemicals, this plant contains large number of proteins which has medicinal impact. Among these proteins, RGA2 is also one of the important protein, and having many clinical significance such as oocyte maturation, fertilization and early embryo development (Balakier et al. 2002). Structurally, RGA2 protein contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains which are involved in diverse biological processes including signal transduction, cell adhesion and the innate immune response. Here, we report a rapid method for purification of RGA2 from Tinospora cordifolia for the first time followed by its structural characterization.\n\nPurification of RGA2\nA summary of a typical purification procedure is given in Table 1. The dialyzed protein precipitated by 90 % ammonium sulfate was subjected to weak anion-exchange chromatography on Hi Trap DEAE FF. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl. We observed four peaks in the chromatogram of the weak anion-exchange elution (Fig. 1). The first peak, eluted at 0.10 M NaCl showing three prominent bands at 50, 35 and 20 kDa along with some low molecular mass impurities on SDS-PAGE. The concentrated pool of partially purified RGA2 protein from Hi Trap DEAE FF column was loaded on the Superdex 200 column, pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). Proteins were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 2.0 ml were collected and monitored for absorbance at 280 nm (Fig. 2). Fractions showing high absorbance at 280 nm were pooled and concentrated for further analysis. The second peak showed a single band at 35 kDa (Fig. 3).Table 1 Purification summary of RGA2\n\nS.No.\tPurification step\tVolume (ml)\tProtein (mg/ml)b\n\tTotal protein (mg)\tYield (100 %)\t\n1\tCrude extracta\n\t880.0\t1.8\t1584\t100\t\n2\tAmmonium sulfate (90 % cut)\t50\t1.6\t80\t5.05\t\n3\tDEAE column (pooled peak)\t55\t1.3\t71\t4.51\t\n4\tSuperdex 200 column (pooled peak)\t20\t1\t20\t1.26\t\n\naFrom 200 g of wet weight of T. cordifolia stem\n\n\nbProtein concentration determined by Lowry assay using BSA as a standard protein\n\nFig. 1 Elution profile [plot of mA280 (milli absorbance at 280 nm) versus elution volume (ml)] of weak anion exchanger Hi Trap DEAE FF.

This band after trypsinization was subjected to mass spectrometry. 13 fragments of different size were obtained after trypsinazation. Molecular mass and sequence of each fragments are shown in Table 2. These fragments were used for the identification of purified protein using mascot search program. A significant mascot score clearly indicates that the purified protein is RGA2 with sequence coverage of 35 %. Since, the sequence of RGA2 is not genbank therefore we considered RGA2 sequence of Triticum aestivum with GenBank: ACO55039.1 to identify the purified protein as RGA2. The purified RGA2 was freeze dried and stored for further uses.Table 2 List of peptide fragments obtained after trypsinization\n\nS.

In addition, analysis of CD spectra helps to estimate the secondary structure composition of a protein (Anwer et al. 2014, 2015; Haque et al. 2015; Khan et al. 2016; Rahaman et al. 2015). Prediction of secondary structure for the CD data measured to 178 nm for α-helix: 0.97 for β-sheet: 0.75 for β-turn: 0.50 and for other structures: 0.89 (Manavalan and Johnson 1987). Structure analyses will also provide an insight into the function of protein (Hassan et al. 2008a, 2010, 2012, 2013). Hence, we performed CD measurements to estimate the secondary structure of purified RGA2.\n\nThe far-UV CD spectrum provided information about secondary structure of RGA2 (Fig. 4). A deep peak at the 222 nm is indication of α-helix in the protein structure. This far-UV CD spectrum was analyzed to determine secondary structure content, we used K2D2 server (Perez-Iratxeta and Andrade-Navarro 2008). The secondary structure convoluted from the spectrum was found to be 18 % of α-helix, 32 % β-Sheet and 50 % are of random coil. We also determined α-helical content of the protein using CD value at 222 nm (Correa and Ramos 2009) to confirm our data obtained by K2D2. We used the procedure given by Morrisett et al. (1973) to determine the amount of α-helix in our protein which came out to be 16 % which is in good agreement with that obtained by K2D2. Thus these results confirmed that our protein has a significant amount of β-Sheet with α-helical content and random coil in different proportion. The crystal structure of RGA2 has not been determined so far. However, we tried to model the RGA2 using the sequence (GenBank: ACO55039.1) and observed a considerable agreement with the structure predicted through CD.Fig. 4 Far-UV CD spectrum of RGA2 at different temperatures in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 8.0. Far-UV CD spectrum at 25 °C, at 85 °C and at 25 °C after cooling is shown in blue, red and green, respectively\n\n\n\nTo check the stability of RGA2, we have measured the CD spectrum at 85 °C and found a significant decrease in the peak intensity at 222 nm (Fig. 4). However, it is interesting to note that this protein is not completely denatured even at 85 °C. We further checked that do such heat-induced denaturation is reversible or not? After cooling the protein from 85 to 25 °C we further measured the far-UV CD spectrum and found a significant gain in the secondary structure after cooling. These observations clearly indicate a reversible nature of RGA2 during heat-induced denaturation.\n\nConclusions\nHere, for the first time we are reporting a simplified procedure for the purification of RGA2 from green stems of Tinospora cordifolia. We have fractionated proteins of RGA2 of green stems of plants using ammonium sulfate and precipitate obtained at 90 % of ammonium sulfate was applied to DEAE-Hi-Trap FF and superdex 200 columns. The purified protein was subjected to MALDI-TOF for identification. We produced a significant amount of RGA2 from Tinospora cordifolia by two-step purification procedure. The method developed in our laboratory results in high yield and purity of RGA2 which may be used for further structural and biochemical studies. Tinospora cordifolia has an importance in traditional Ayurvedic medicine used for ages in the treatment and hence, studies on RGA2 will further strengthen our understanding for the medicinal significance of this plant.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (PDF 124 kb)\n\n \n\nWe thank Ch.

Enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of NAD, i.e. alkaline phosphatase, aminohydrolase and glycohydrolase were determined. Alkaline phosphatase was found to catalyse the sequential hydrolysis of two phosphate moieties of NAD molecule to nicotinamide riboside plus adenosine. Adenosine was then deaminated by aminohydrolase to inosine and ammonia. While glycohydrolase catalyzed the hydrolysis of the nicotinamide-ribosidic bond of NAD+ to produce nicotinamide and ADP-ribose in equimolar amounts, enzyme purification through a 3-step purification procedure revealed the existence of two peaks of alkaline phosphatases, and one peak contained deaminase and glycohydrolase activities. NAD deaminase was purified to homogeneity as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass of 91 kDa. Characterization and determination of some of NAD aminohydrolase kinetic properties were conducted due to its biological role in the regulation of cellular NAD level. The results also revealed that NAD did not exert its feedback control on nicotinamide amidase produced by P. brevicompactum.\n\nKeywords\nNAD degradationPenicillium brevicompactum NRC 829Alkaline phosphatasesDeaminaseGlycohydrolaseissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nIncreasing evidences have indicated that NAD and NADH play critical roles not only in energy metabolism, but also in several cellular functions including calcium homeostasis, gene expression, ageing, immunological mechanisms and cell death (Leonarda 2008). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its reduced form NADH are essential cofactors for many redox biocatalysts. Because these cofactors are consumed in stoichiometric amounts, whole-cell biocatalysts have been routinely employed to reduce the costs. To further improve the efficacy of redox biocatalysts, it is essential to maintain the stability of nicotinamide cofactors, for which it is necessary to block degradation pathways for NAD (H). While the biosynthesis of NAD (H) has been well studied, it is less understood how NAD (H) are degraded (Wang et al. 2014).\n\nAmong studies on NAD degradation by non-pathogenic microorganisms, filamentous fungi are found to be particularly interesting because of their easy cultivation, high production of extracellular enzymes with large industrial potential. Besides, fungal enzymes are more resistant to harsh climatic conditions than other sources. These enzymes are applied in the industrialization of chemical and biomedical products (Guimarães et al. 2006). As newly discovered eukaryotic NAD precursors, NR and NaR have the potential to be important mammalian nutritional supplements and/or drugs (Ma et al. 2007; Bogan and Brenner 2008). Alkaline phosphatases involved in NAD degradation which cleave NAD at the phosphate linkage to produce ADP and nicotinamide riboside have been characterized earlier in our laboratory from A. niger (Elzainy and Ali 2000), A. terreus (Elzainy and Ali 2003, 2005). Subsequently, alkaline phosphatase splits ADP to AMP plus free inorganic phosphate. AMP was further cleaved by the same enzyme to produce adenosine plus Pi. Non-specific degradation of NAD to nicotinamide riboside was detected in Escherichia coli (Wang et al. 2014). The applications of alkaline phosphatase isolated from different sources are reviewed with special reference to the macromolecular structure and action mechanism of the enzyme in the reactions of phosphomonoester hydrolysis. The practicality of alkaline phosphatase as a helpful tool in conducting enzyme-linked immunoassays is demonstrated (Zueva et al. 1993).\n\nN-glycosidic linkage of the released nicotinamide riboside was hydrolytically cleaved by glycohydrolase from the same organism producing nicotinamide (Nm) and free ribose. A glycohydrolase is highly specific for NMN. NAD, NADP, nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide riboside catalyses (Imai 1979). On the other hand, studies on NAD+ biosynthesis originate from the involvement of NAD+ in skin cancer prevention mechanisms that include enhancing DNA repair and preventing photo-immune suppression. In addition, NAD+ serves as a cofactor for energy generation used in cornified epidermal barrier formation and release of agents with protective effects on skin (Leonarda 2008).\n\nAdenosine aminohydrolase (ADA) participates in the purine metabolism, whereas it degrades either adenosine or 2′-deoxyadenosine producing inosine or 2′-deoxyinosine, respectively (Kocic et al. 1991). The physiological function of ADA is critical in controlling the effects of these metabolites on immunological, neurological and vascular systems. ADA is also involved in the development of T. lymphocytes band as it is evident from the fact that ADA deficient animals suffer from B and T lymphopaenia (Ray and Sharma 2002; Ashok et al. 2008). Serum ADA levels increase in pancreatic disorders, especially in pancreatic cancer; therefore it may be used as a serum marker for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (Bi et al. 2007). The evidence of high ADA activity during rapid and stimulated growth of normal tissues is of importance in making a fully functional purine salvage pathway possible (Seiler 2004). Adenosine deaminase of Aspergillus oryzae (Ali et al. 2012, 2014) has been characterized in our laboratory. Both the adenosine and by-products of the NAD-consuming enzymes such as NMN and Nm can be recycled back to NAD (Sorcil et al. 2010; Gazzaniga et al. 2009). Therefore, the present research focused on studying in detail the degradation of NAD+ by Penicillium brevicompactum NRC 829 extracts. Besides, NAD aminohydrolase was purified to homogeneity and some of kinetic properties were characterized.\n\nMaterials and methods\nChemicals\nAdenosine, adenine, inosine, cytosine, guanine, cytidine, adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP), guanosine 5′-monophosphate (GMP), NAD and cytidine 5′-monophosphate (CMP) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company. Nicotinamide and nicotinic acid were purchased from Merck. DEAE-Sephadex A-25 and Sephadex G-100 were from Pharmacia Fine Chemical. All other reagents were prepared in Microbial Chemistry Department, National Research Centre.\n\nMicroorganism\nPenicillium brevicompactum NRC 829 was obtained from culture collection of Microbial Chemistry Department, National Research Centre, Dokki, Egypt.\n\nMedium\nThe selected fungal strain was grown and maintained on slants of solid modified Czapek Dox’s medium containing g l−1 distilled water: glucose, 30; NaNO3, 2.0; KH2PO4, 1.0; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5; KCl, 0.5 and agar, 20.\n\nPreparation of Penicillium brevicompactum extracts\nThe 4-day-old mats, grown on liquid modified potato dextrose medium, containing per litre 300 g of potato and 20 g dextrose at 28 °C, were harvested by filtration, washed thoroughly with distilled water and blotted to dry with absorbent paper. The mats were then ground with cold washed sand in a chilled mortar and extracted with cold distilled water. The slurry obtained was centrifuged at 1, 5229×g for 10 min and the supernatant was used as the crude enzyme preparation.\n\nEnzyme assay\nAlkaline phosphatase was determined according to the method described by Heninone and Lahti (1981), summarized as follows: the stock solutions consist of 10 mM (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O, 1 M citric acid and 5 N H2SO4, all in distilled water and stable at least for several weeks at 25 °C. Acetone–acid–molybdate (AAM) solution was prepared daily by mixing 1 vol of ammonium molybdate solution with 1 vol of 5 N H2SO4 and 2 vol of acetone. Inorganic phosphate determination: into a test tube containing 0.5 ml of sample, 4 ml of AAM solution was added. The contents were mixed carefully with a vortex mixer and 0.4 ml of 1 M citric acid was pipetted into each tube. After mixing, the yellow colour observed was measured at 390–420 nm. A sample with no added Pi was used as a blank. Adenosine deaminase activity was determined as ammonia according to the method described by Vogel (1961). Briefly, 0.5 ml of purified enzyme solution was mixed with 0.5 ml of Tris–acetate buffer (0.2 M, pH 5.0) containing 5 µM NAD. The mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 30 min and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of Nessler’s reagent. The yellow colour formed was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring its absorbance at 450 nm. Nicotinamide riboside glycohydrolase was determined by the method described by Shin et al. (1999). Unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 µM of product, i.e. NH3 or Pi or ribose, per min under the standard assay conditions.\n\nProtein determination\nProtein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (1951), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The protein content of the purified enzyme fractions was determined by the UV absorbance according to the method of Schleif and Wensink (1981).\n\nThin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis\nEnzymatic reaction products were assayed by TLC Silica gel 60254 (Aluminium sheet) (20 × 20 cm) according to a procedure presented by Kemmer et al. (2001) and Lee et al. (2000). Reactions were done at 40 °C for 2 h in 80 µl of Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) that contained 5 µM NAD and 0.4 mg ml−1 enzyme of P. brevicompactum. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 µl of 2 M HCl and centrifuged at 12,000×g for 10 min. Samples were spotted onto TLC sheet, developed in a, n-butanol:acetone:acetic acid (glacial):ammonia (5 %):water (45:15:10:10:20) mixture (Smith and Seakins 1976) and visualized under UV at 254 nm.\n\nSeparation and partial purification of NAD degrading enzymes\nAcetone fractionation\nCold acetone (−20 °C) was added to the crude extract at various concentrations of 0–30, 30–60, 60–90 %, respectively. The suspension formed was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The precipitate formed was collected and dissolved in a minimal volume of Tris–acetate buffer, pH 7.0 (0.02 M).\n\nDialysis\nThe sample obtained after acetone fractionation was dialysed for 3 h against cold distilled water at 7 °C using a dialysis bag (Size 3, 20/32–15.9 mm, Medicell International Ltd).\n\nDEAE-Sephadex A-25 chromatography\nThe dialysed partially purified enzymes were loaded onto a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (1.0 × 45 cm) that was pre-equilibrated with the same buffer (0.1 M). Elution was carried at room temperature by batch-wise additions of 50 ml portions of increasing molarities (0.0–0.5 M) of sodium chloride solutions in 0.1 M Tris–acetate buffer pH 7, at flow rate 20 ml h−1. Fractions of 5.0 ml were collected and analysed for protein and the enzyme activities were determined as described previously. Fractions with high enzyme activities were pooled together, dialysed against the same buffer and finally concentrated by lyophilization (−50 °C) for further analysis.\n\nSephadex G-100 gel filtration\nThe lyophilized concentrated solution was further loaded onto Sephadex G-100 column (46 × 2.0 cm), which was equilibrated in 0.1 M Tris–acetate buffer pH 7.0. The enzyme was eluted from the column using the same buffer at a flow rate of 30 ml h−1, at room temperature (25 °C). The fractions were analysed for protein, Pi, NH3 and ribose determination.\n\nSpecific activity was expressed as µmol NH3 or Pi or ribose liberated from substrate (NAD) per mg protein per min. Appropriate control reaction mixtures, i.e. the enzyme source or the substrate was used as blanks throughout the work. All the experiments cited in this work were conducted in triplicate and the mean values were reported and all the results recorded were reproducible.\n\nMolecular mass determination by SDS-PAGE\nSDS-gel electrophoresis technique was used to detect the purity of enzyme and to determine molecular mass of the purified enzyme from P. brevicompactum NRC 829 according to the method described by Laemmli (1970), by using the following proteins which were used as molecular weight standards (Fermentas) (spectra TM multicolor broad range protein ladder): 250, 150, 100, 70, 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10 kDa.\n\nExtent of NAD degradation by P. brevicompactum extracts\nThe experiment aimed to determine the extent of NAD degradation when P. brevicompactum extracts were incubated with NAD as a substrate, at optimum pH and temperature. The release Pi, NH3 and ribose were colourimetrically analysed at different time intervals over a period of 3 h.\n\nDetermination of optimal pH, temperature and stability\nThe optimal pH of the purified enzymes was determined by performing the enzyme assays in the appropriate buffers: KCl–HCl (pH 1.0–2.0); Tris–acetate (pH 3–6.0); Tris–HCl (pH 6.0–9.0) and carbonate–bicarbonate (pH 9.0–10.0). Temperatures of the enzyme were determined by performing the enzyme assays within the temperature range of 20–80 °C. The thermal stability of the purified enzymes was examined by measuring the residual activity after incubating the enzyme at each desired temperature for 30 min.\n\nInfluence of different compounds on the purified enzyme activity\nThe purified enzymes were pre-incubated with different compounds (10 mM) at 40 °C for 30 min in Tris–acetate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.0). The metal ions and some modulators were Fe2+, Fe3+, CO2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+. The enzyme activities was determined as described above using NAD as substrate. The enzyme activity without any agent was taken as 100 %.\n\nSubstrate specificity\nSubstrate specificity was investigated by replacing NAD in the assay mixture with an equal concentration of the representative phosphorylated, aminated riboside compounds.\n\nKinetics of P. brevicompactum NAD aminohydrolase\nKinetic parameters of P. brevicompactum aminohydrolase against NAD were determined in triplicates at 40◦C for 30 min. Various concentrations of NAD+ (1.5–20 μM) in 50 mM Tris-acetate buffer (pH 6.0) were used in the reaction mixture. Released ammonia was assayed discontinuously as previously described.\n\nResults and discussion\nExtent of NAD degradation\nPenicillium brevicompactum NRC 829 extracts were incubated with NAD at different pH values. The results observed indicated that Pi and NH3 were optimally liberated from NAD at pH 8 and pH 6.0, respectively, while reducing sugar was optimally detected at pH 5.0. In addition, it was also found that the release of phosphate in the reaction adjusted at pH 8 was faster than the reactions at pH 6 or pH 5 (Fig. 1). Complete phosphate hydrolysis could be detected in the reaction mixtures after 3 h of incubation. The observed properties of phosphatases isolated from P. brevicompactum were similar to fungal phosphatases produced by A. niger (Elzainy and Ali 2000), A. terreus (Elzainy and Ali 2003) and A. oryzae (Ali et al. 2012). These enzymes are similar in being orthophosphate- non repressible enzymes and being not true phosphomonoesterases. This last property was based on their abilities to catalyse the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate linkage of ADP and the internal ester linkage between NR and ADP, in addition to the true phosphate ester linkages of NAD, ADP and AMP. At the end of the incubation period, almost all the phosphate links of the dinucleotide molecule were cleaved, while about 40 % either of the amido- or the amino-linkages were hydrolysed. However, this percentage may represent the sum of percentages of hydrolysed amido- and amino-bonds. Also the reducing power of 32 % may be formed as a result of the cleavage of N-glycosidic bond in adenosine or nicotinamide riboside.Fig. 1 Optimal pH of NAD degrading enzymes. The reaction mixture contained the following: substrate, NAD, 5 µmol; buffers of various pHs: 80 µmol (pH 3–6) citrate-buffer, (pH 6–9) Tris–acetate, (pH 9–10) carbonate–bicarbonate buffer; temp., 50 °C; protein extracts, 2.5 mg\n\n\n\nNAD degradation pathway by the extracts of P. brevicompactum was summarized as shown in the following diagram.\n\nIdentification of products and intermediates of NAD degradation\nAnalysis of the reaction mixture, in which inorganic phosphate, ribose and ammonia were formed, showed the extent of NAD degradation by P. brevicompactum enzymes. TLC clearly indicated that NAD was consumed, but there was apparently no accumulation of either ADP or AMP. Instead, the presence of NR, Nm, adenosine and inosine was evident for those lanes. These data showed that the end product NAD dephosphorylation was nicotinamide riboside (NR) and adenosine. Subsequently, adenosine was partially deaminated to inosine, while nicotinamide riboside was cleaved to nicotinamide and ribose. Adenosine, inosine, nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide were located on TLC sheet as the final products (Fig. 2). These results are in agreement with that reported for NAD degradation in the extracts of A. niger (Elzainy and Ali 2000), A. terreus (Elzainy and Ali 2003) and A.oryzae (Ali et al. 2012); however, the present research differs regarding the formation of nicotinamide which formed due to the existence of NAD glycohydrolase, while, in case of other fungal strains, nicotinamide riboside remained without further degradation. The detection of inosine and adenosine in the chromatographic analysis demonstrated the partial deamination of adenosine. This result is in congruent with the result previously investigated in A.oryzae extracts (Ali et al. 2012).Fig. 2 TLC analysis of products from NAD degradation activity of P. brevicompactum aminohydrolase. Right lane was the sample of reaction mixture containing 5 µM NAD being treated at 50 °C for 2 h by aminohydrolase at an initial concentration of 20 µg. Concentrations of chemical standards were 2 mM. Abbreviations of authentic: NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; AMP, adenosine 5′-monophosphate; ADP, adenosine 5′-diphosphate; Ado, adenosine; Ade, adenine; Ino, inosine; Nm, nicotinamide; NR, nicotinamide riboside\n\n\n\nSeparation of NAD deaminating and NAD glycohydrolase activities from NAD dephosphorylating activity\nThe data presented in Table 1 showed the purification summary of the three enzymes responsible for NAD degradation. During all purification steps, the activity of alkaline phosphatase was detected in protein fractions with two peaks; this result indicates the existence of two molecular forms of alkaline isozymes. In addition, the activities of NAD glycohydrolase and NAD deaminating were recorded in one peak. The separation of NAD glycohydrolase and NAD deaminase was illustrated by Sephadex G-100 column chromatography described under ‘‘Materials and Methods’’ section. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity. SDS-PAGE showed that it had a molecular mass of 91 kDa (Fig. 3). In this respect, the molecular masses of 94 and 85 kDa were reported for the enzymes produced by A.oryzae and A. fumigatus 4 as investigated by Ali et al. (2014) and Yoshimune et al. (2005), respectively. On the other hand, the purified enzyme from A. oryzae was found to exhibit a smaller molecular mass of 14.5 kDa as reported by Rosinova et al. (1978).Table 1 Purification of the NAD degrading enzymes from P. brevicompactum NRC 829\n\nPurification steps\tTotal activity (units)\tProtein (mg)\tSp. activity\tRecovery (%)\tPurification fold\t\nAlkaline phosphatase\t\n Crude extracts\t600\t390\t1.5\t100\t1\t\n Acetone fraction\t562\t150\t3.7\t93\t2.5\t\n DEAE-Sephadex A25\t\n  ALK1\t230\t3.0\t60.6\t38\t51.1\t\n  ALK2\t200\t2.8\t71.4\t33\t47.6\t\nNAD aminohydrolase\t\n Crude extracts\t450\t390\t1.1\t100\t1\t\n Acetone fraction\t400\t150\t2.6\t88\t2.2\t\n DEAE-Sephadex A25\t150\t5\t30\t30\t27.3\t\n Sephadex G-100\t100\t2\t50\t22\t41\t\nNAD glycohydrolase\t\n Crude extracts\t290\t390\t0.75\t100\t1\t\n Acetone-fraction\t245\t150\t1.6\t84\t2.1\t\n DEAE-Sephadex A 25\t130\t5\t27\t44\t36\t\n Sephadex G-100\t76\t1.9\t40\t26\t50\t\nFig. 3 Electrophoretic analysis of Penicillium brevicompactum NRC 829 NAD aminohydrolase.

The results illustrated in Fig. 4 demonstrated that the deaminase displayed optimal activity at pH 6.0. The enzyme was stable when pre incubated in the pH range of 6.0 to 8.0, while 50 and 55 % of its original activity were observed at pHs 4.0 and 9.0, respectively (Fig. 5). This is similar to the optimal pH (5–7) of adenosine-phosphate deaminase of A. fumigatus (Yoshimune et al. 2005), NAD deaminase produced by A.oryzae (Ali et al. 2014). At pH 8.0, the deaminase loses 40 % of its activity as A.oryzae NAD deaminase, which had its optimum activity at pH 5 and abroad pH stability. The optimal temperature for the deaminase activity was in the range of 50–70 °C (Fig. 6). This is about 10–20 °C higher than optimum temperature of the adenosine-phosphate deaminase of A. fumigatus (Yoshimune et al. 2005) and NAD deaminase A.oryzae (Ali et al. 2014), respectively. The enzyme was found to thermostable up to 70 °C; the results also showed that 80 and 88 % of its original activity still remained at 50 and 60 °C, respectively, after 30 min of incubation (Data not shown). The enzyme purified from P. brevicompactum was considerably more thermostable with higher specific activity than deaminase of A. fumigatus and A.oryzae.Fig. 4 pH dependence of the purified deaminase activity\n\nFig. 5 pH stability of the NAD aminohydrolase. The enzyme was stored in buffers of various pHs (100 mM) at 50 °C for 30 min, and the residual activities were measured\n\nFig. 6 Effect of temperature on purified deaminase\n\n\n\nEffect of various agents on the purified enzyme activity\nIn the present study, results in Table 2 clearly showed that the enzyme was enhanced about 30 % by Zn2+ (1 mM), while no significant enhancement of the enzyme activity was reported by Ca2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and Fe3+. In addition, the present data revealed that the enzyme activity was not inhibited by iodoacetate, used at 10 mM final concentration, which clearly indicates the absence of evidence for the involvement of an SH group(s) in the catalytic action of enzyme. The effect of EDTA, known as a metal chelating agent, on enzyme activity was tested to find out whether this enzyme is a metalloenzyme or not. It was found that the addition of EDTA (10 mM) to the reaction mixture did not inhibit enzyme activity indicating that NAD deaminase is not a metalloenzyme. This property closely resembles that of a nonspecific NAD aminohydrolase produced from A. oryzae (Ali et al. 2014); whereas the enzyme was slightly activated by addition of Na+ and K+, while inhibited by addition of Mn2+, Ag+, Hg2+, and Cu2+. In this concern, Yoshimune et al. (2005) reported that the adenosine-phosphate deaminase produced by A. fumigatus was inhibited by 38 % in the presence of Cu2+ (1 mM), while no significant enhancement of the enzyme activity was reported by Ba2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Sn2+, Zn2+ and Fe3+. Yoshino and Murakami (1980) reported that the baker’s yeast AMP deaminase was activated in the presence of various divalent cations.Table 2 Effect of metal ions and various chemical reagents on the enzyme activity\n\nReagents (1 mM)\tRelative activity (%)\t\nNone\t100\t\nZn2+\n\t132\t\nCa2+\n\t92\t\nCo2+\n\t94\t\nFe2+\n\t95\t\nMg2+\n\t90\t\nMn2\n\t91\t\nFe3+\n\t89\t\nEDTA\t92\t\nIodoacetate\t93\t\nMercaptoethanol\t96\t\n\n\nSubstrate specificity\nThe substrate specificity of purified NAD deaminase was examined and the results were tabulated in Table 3, from which it was found that the enzyme was active toward adenine and various adenine derivatives (adenosine, AMP, ADP, NAD, ATP and NAD) while no activity was detected towards nicotinamide or nicotinamide riboside as a nonspecific NAD aminohydrolase from A. oryzae (Ali et al. 2014). In contrast, A.terreus NAD deamidase catalysed amide group of the intact NAD molecule and could also cleave the amide group from NMN, NR, Nm, glutamine and asparagine (Elzainy and Ali 2005). The microbial AMP-deaminating activity was catalysed by adenosine-phosphate deaminase (EC 3.5.4.17) and adenylic acid deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6) (Yoshimune et al. 2005). The enzyme from Takadiastase (A. oryzae) was identified as a nonspecific adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4, adenosine aminohydrolase) by Minato et al. (1965); this enzyme deaminated various adenosine derivatives (3′-AMP, 5′-AMP, and NAD), but not adenine or NADP. The enzymes from A. oryzae and A. fumigatus 4 were different in substrate specificity, as described above. The enzyme from S. aureofaciens catalyses the deamination of adenosine, 5′-AMP, ADP and ATP, but not that of adenine (Rosinova et al. 1978). The enzyme from Streptomyces sp. is active towards adenosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine, 3′-AMP, 5′-AMP and cAMP (Jun et al. 1991), but the enzyme activities towards 3′-AMP, 5′-AMP and cAMP were 4– 8 % of those of adenosine, indicating that Streptomyces sp. enzyme is classified as adenosine deaminase. As described above, the substrate specificities of microbial adenosine-phosphate deaminases are different depending on the origin of the enzymes.Table 3 Kinetic parameters of P. brevicompactum aminohydrolase\n\nSubstrate\t\nK\nm (µM)\t\nK\ncat (s−1)\t\nK\ncat/K\nm (M−1 s−1)\t\nNAD\t5.2\t10.08\t1.93\t\nAMP\t8.33\t8.12\t0.98\t\nADP\t6.25\t0.93\t0.207\t\nAdenosine\t4.5\t11.2\t1.79\t\nNicotinamide riboside\tND\tND\tND\t\n\nND not detected\n\n\n\nKinetic parameters of NAD aminohydrolase\nKinetic parameters of P. brevicompactum aminohydrolase catalysis were determined using NAD, ADP, AMP and adenosine, as substrates (Table 3). While Km values were close for all of these substrates, Kcat values for AMP and ADP were orders of magnitude higher than those for NAD and adenosine, indicating that aminohydrolase had substantially higher catalytic efficiency for ammonia hydrolysis. It should be pointed out that the P. brevicompactum had the highest NAD and adenosine aminohydrolase activity compared to the enzyme produced by A. oryzae (Ali et al. 2014). The Km values for NAD (5.2 µM) and adenosine (4.5 µM) of P. brevicompactum were substantially lower; indicating aminohydrolase has much stronger binding affinity towards NAD and adenosine compared to other enzymes for NAD degradation.\n\nConclusion\nThe present work demonstrated the occurrence of two alkaline phosphatases, aminohydrolase and glycohydrolase in P. brevicompactum NRC 829. These enzymes are involved in NAD degradation. Purification and separation showed high aminohydrolase activity with the catalytic efficiencies for hydrolysis of NAD and adenosine at 1.9 and 1.8 μM−1 s−1, respectively. These results significantly enriched our understanding on NAD metabolism and should facilitate many applications including designing redox biocatalysts.\n\nThis work was supported by National Research Centre of Egypt.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interest.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAli TH  Haroun BM  Tantawy AE   Optimization of culture conditions for the production of NAD-degrading enzymes by Aspergillus oryzae  NRRL 447 Adv Food Sci 2012 34 4 195 201 \nAli TH  Ali NH  Haroun BM  Tantawy AE   Purification and properties of Aspergillus oryzae  NRRL 447 aminohydrolase World J Microbiol Biotechnol 2014 30 819 825 10.1007/s11274-013-1483-1 24158390 \nAshok KJ  Pinto GJ  Kavitha AK  Palathra MJ   The diagnostic and prognostic value of serum adenosine deaminase levels in head and neck cancer J Clin Diagn Res 2008 3 833 837 \nBi M  Koklu S  Meric Y  Basar O  Yilmaz G  Yuksel O  Yildirim E  Ozturk Z   Serum adenosine deaminase levels in pancreatic diseases Pancreat 2007 7 5 6 \nBogan KL  Brenner C   Nicotinic acid, nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside: a molecular evaluation of NAD precursor vitamins in human nutrition Annu Rev Nutr 2008 28 115 130 10.1146/annurev.nutr.28.061807.155443 18429699 \nElzainy TA  Ali TH   Pathways of NADP and NAD degradation by Aspergillus niger  extracts Ann Microbiol 2000 50 65 75 \nElzainy TA  Ali TH   Nature and mode of action of NAD and ATP dephosphorylating enzyme from Aspergillus terreus  DSM 826 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek J Microbiol 2003 84 255 260 10.1023/A:1026028311575 14574102 \nElzainy TA  Ali TH   NAD deamidation, a non-previously recognized reaction, by an enzyme from Aspergillus terreus  DSM 826 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek J Microbiol 2005 87 119 129 10.1007/s10482-004-0136-7 15793621 \nGazzaniga F  Stebbins R  Chang SZ  McPeek MA  Brenner C   Microbial NAD metabolism Microbiol Mol Biol Rev 2009 73 3 529 10.1128/MMBR.00042-08 19721089 \nGuimarães LHS  Peixoto-Nogueira SC  Michele Michelin M  Rizzatti ACS  Sandrim VC  Zanoelo FF  Aquino ACMM  Junior AB  Maria de Lourdes TM  Polizeli MLTM   Screening of filamentous fungi for production of enzymes of biotechnological interest Braz J Microbiol 2006 37 474 480 10.1590/S1517-83822006000400014 \nHeninone JK  Lahti RJ   A new and convenient colorimetric determination of inorganic orthophosphate and its application to the assay of inorganic pyrophosphatase J Biochem 1981 113 313 317 \nImai T   Isolation and properties of a glycohydrolase specific for nicotinamide mononucleotide from Azotobacter vinelandii  J Biochem 1979 85 4 887 899 457634 \nJun HK  Kim TS  Sakai T   Purification and characterization of extracellular adenosine deaminase from a Streptomyces  sp J Ferment Bioeng 1991 71 6 11 10.1016/0922-338X(91)90295-R \nKemmer G  Reilly T  Schmidt-Brauns J  Zlotnik GW  Green BA  Fiske MJ  Herbert M  Kraiβ A  Schlör S  Smith A  Reidl J   NadN and e  (P4) are essential for the utilization of NAD and nicotinamide mononucleotide but not nicotinamide riboside in Haemophilus influenzae  J Bacteriol 2001 183 3974 3981 10.1128/JB.183.13.3974-3981.2001 11395461 \nKocic G  Stanojevic G  Nagorni A  Brankvic B  Pavlovic D  Jevtovic T   Diagnostic importance of adenosine deaminase activity for progression and invasion of human colon tumors Med Biol 1991 10 2 76 78 \nLaemmli UK   Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4 Nature (London) 1970 227 680 685 10.1038/227680a0 5432063 \nLee KS  Song SB  Kim KE  Kim YH  Kim SK  Kho BH  Ko DK  Choi YK  Lee K  Kim CK  Kim YC  Lim JY  Kim Y  Min KH  Wanner BL   Cloning and characterization of the UDP-sugar hydrolase gene (ushA) of Enterobacter aerogenes  IFO 12010 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2000 269 526 531 10.1006/bbrc.2000.2328 10708587 \nLeonarda S (2008) NAD Metabolism: aspects of biosynthesis and degradation.

Venkata issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nPhytosynthesis methods of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are emerging as a potential alternative to physical and chemical processes, ever since the first report on Geranium leaf cell free extract mediated synthesis (Shankar et al. 2003), and demonstration of their applications in a number of fields including medicine. The properties and specific applications of AgNPs depend on their shape, size and dispersion. Cell free extract method offers a number of possibilities and flexibility to control various parameters determining the architecture of the nanoparticle. Live plants posses innate nanoparticle synthetic ability as a part of biomineralization, fortification and metal tolerance traits, was evolved to colonize metalliferous soils, this nanoparticle fabrication potential was demonstrated in many plant systems (Marchiol 2012). Efficient and stable synthesis of AgNPs depends on plant species employed and nature of extract.\n\nVaried primary and secondary metabolites of plants, viz., proteins, enzymes, polysaccharides, amino acids and vitamins, antioxidants, flavonoids, flavones, isoflavones, catechins, anthocyanidins, isothiocyanates, carotenoids, polyphenols were attributed as reducing and stabilization agents in the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles (Park et al. 2011). The availability of vast metabolite diversity and unexplored potential of exotic and rare plant systems, a lot of attention is being paid to combine phytochemistry and nanotechnology to develop nanomaterials with desirable size and morphology.\n\nAntimicrobial activity of AgNPs was most extensively evaluated for applications in the medical field to prepare medicines, devices, implants, polymers and dressing material to control infections. Biosynthetic AgNPs are preferred due to their enhanced antimicrobial activity over silver ions and biocompatibility. Antimicrobial activity of AgNPs varies with their size (Panacek et al. 2006), and phytosynthesis of AgNPs with varied size and morphology was reported earlier (Mohanpuria et al. 2008) by employing different plant species.\n\nCouroupita guianensis, a member of threatened list (local name: Cannon ball tree) is one of the two species representing Lecythidaceae family, found rarely in Botanical gardens and temples in India. Various plant parts viz., leaves, flowers, fruit and bark possess antibacterial, antifungal, antiseptic and analgesic qualities. The flowers are used to cure cold, stomach aches, intestinal gas formation and Diarrhea (Prabhu and Subban 2012).\n\nGenerally different parts of flower buds are loaded with antimicrobial and other compounds to protect vital reproductive process. Several chemical constituents with novel structures and bio-active moieties viz. aliphatic hydrocarbon, stigmasterol, alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids, isatin and terpenoids have been reported from the flowers (Rane et al. 2001; Wong and Tie 1995). Similar phytochemical principles reported from Couroupita flowers are implicated in antimicrobial activity, reduction of metal ions and stabilization of AgNPs from other plant systems (Mohanpuria et al. 2008). In the light of the above background, we hypothesize that potential antimicrobial formulations can be developed by combining antimicrobial activity of phytochemicals and their potential to synthesize AgNPs. Here, we report efficient synthesis of AgNPs using Couroupita flower bud extract and their synergistic antibacterial activity for the first time.\n\nMaterials and methods\nPreparation of aqueous extract and synthesis of AgNPs\nFlower buds [5, 10 and 15 days old] were collected from the plant growing in the Botanical Garden of Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati. The age of flower bud, concentration and volume of extract of silver nitrate solution for the synthesis of AgNPs were optimized and based on preliminary results, 5 days old, 20 % (FW/Vol.) and 0.01 ml extract/30 ml AgNO3 was chosen. The aqueous extract was prepared by boiling 5 g of flower bud pieces in 25 ml of deionized water for 5 min and the filtrate were used as reducing and stabilizing agent. In a typical AgNPs synthesis reaction, 0.01 ml of flower buds broth was added to 30 ml of 10−3 M AgNO3 and kept in dark at room temperature. The reaction leading to AgNPs synthesis was monitored visually, i.e., the appearance of yellowish brown color and spectral characteristics using UV spectrophotometer.\n\nCharacterization of AgNPs\nThe reduction of Ag+ to Ag0 was monitored by UV–visible absorption spectrum (Jasco Corp., UV-530), in the range of 300–700 nm periodically. For the spectral analysis, reaction mixture was diluted with Milli Q water (1:9 ratio) and measurements were carried out as a function of reaction time at room temperature. The colloidal solution of AgNPs was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. This process was repeated for five times by redispersing the pellet into Milli-Q water and the final pellet obtained was air dried and this dried powder of AgNPs was used for further analysis.\n\nA thin film of dried powder of AgNPs on a glass substrate was used to obtain X-ray powder diffraction data by PAN analytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer. The Scanning was done in Bragg–Brentano geometry using step-scan technique and Johansson monochromator to produce pure Cu αK radiation (1.5406 A; 45 kV, 40 MA) in the range of 10° to 90° at a rate of 2 min−1. The crystalline size was calculated using the Debye–Scherrer’s equation.\n\nTEM image was acquired and measurements were performed on a JEM-2100 (JEOL, Germany), operated at an acceleration of 300 kV. The Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) pattern was obtained by directing the electron beam perpendicular to one of the spheres.\n\nThe thin film on silicon cover glass containing the dried AgNPs sample was analyzed using Atomic Force Microscope (NT-MDT AFM NEXT, Germany). The elemental nature of the nano silver sample was analyzed through EDX using Oxford Inca Penta FET X3 EDX instrument connected to Carl Zeiss EAO MA 15 Scanning Electron Microscope.\n\nFTIR measurements of powdered samples of AgNPs and flower bud extract were carried out on VERTEX K-ALPHA FT-IR Spectrophotometer (Bruker, Germany). Spectra were taken in the wave number range of 500–4000 cm−1 without adding the KBr pellets.\n\nAntibacterial activity\nEight bacterial pathogens, including four Gram positive {(Bacillus cereus (MTCC-4079), Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC-7443), Micrococcus luteus (MTCC-7256) and Bacillus subtilis (MTCC-1133)} and four Gram negative strains {Escherichia coli (MTCC-1668), Klebsiella pneumonia (MTCC-7028), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC-7296) and Salmonella typhimurium (MTCC-98)} were obtained from Microbial Type Collection Center, Chandigarh, India for antibacterial studies.\n\nAntibacterial activity of silver nitrate, extract of flower buds and AgNPs was performed following Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method. Bacterial strains, which are at Log phase (108 cfu/ml) were standardized against McFarland’s standard and were swabbed on to Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates. For the preparation of discs, 20 µl (50 µg/ml) each of the test solutions was used along with standard drug gentamicin (10 µg) for comparison. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and the zone of inhibition was measured by MIC scale. Triplicates were maintained for each treatment. The results were subjected to one-way ANOVA followed by Dennett’s test (**P < 0.05).\n\nResults and discussion\nSynthesis and UV–visible analysis\nSynthesis of AgNPs by reduction of silver ions by the phyto-constituents of the extract were initially observed with the appearance of characteristic yellowish brown color, which is due to excitation of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) phenomena (Mulvaney 1996).\n\nThe intensity of color increased, as more and more silver ions got reduced with reaction time and attained stable dark chocolate brown color at 72 h.\n\nThe progress of the silver ion reduction was monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy analysis in the wavelength range from 300 to 700 nm at periodic intervals (1 min to 72 h) (Fig. 1), further synthesis was confirmed by characteristic SPR band at 415–420 nm.Fig. 1 UV–visible analysis of AgNPs showing a typical SPR band from 415–420 nm recorded as a function of reaction time of 10−3 M AgNO3 aqueous solution with Couroupita guianensis flower bud extract\n\n\n\nThe height of the peak increased with reaction time and was stable at 72 h with an absorption maximum at 420 nm. This absorption maximum is a characteristic feature of AgNPs, as reported from chemical (Kong and Jang 2006), and biosynthesis methods (Logeswari et al. 2012). Generally, the SPR bands are influenced by the size, shape, morphology, composition and the dielectric environment of the prepared nanoparticles (Ahmad et al. 2010). A single, narrow absorption peak centered at 420 nm indicates uniform spherical AgNPs, as expected according to Mie’s theory (Mie 1908).\n\nThere was no obvious change in colour intensity, spectral peak position and optical density of the colloid, when monitored at regular intervals over a period of 4 months. This confirms the colloidal stability and uniformity of the hydrosol, as reported earlier in green synthesis studies (Pasupuleti et al. 2013).\n\nThe efficiency of plant extract in the synthesis of AgNPs depends on the phytochemical composition and concentration of the extract, the ratio of plant extract to AgNO3, time taken for initiation, completion of synthesis and their stability. The extract of 5 days old buds was found to be efficient in terms of the ratio of the extract to silver solution (1:3000), which is several fold less compared to the earlier reports (Usha Rani and Rajasekharreddy 2011) and rate of reduction. Hence, Couroupita flower bud extract is more efficient in the reduction of silver ions and stabilization of so formed AgNPs, when compared to the many earlier green synthesis reports (Logeswari et al. 2012). This may be due to the high concentration of reducing agents or more efficient, reducing compounds and stabilizing agents present in the extract at that particular developmental stage of buds.\n\nMorphological characterization\nThe powder XRD pattern of AgNPs revealed a total of 10 peaks (Fig. 2). The Bragg reflection values of four major peaks 38.314, 44.405, 64.400, and 76.506 at 2θ value corresponds to (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystallographic planes respectively, of the face centered cubic structure of a typical silver crystal. These four intense broad peaks reflected a high degree of crystallinity and smaller size of the AgNPs.Fig. 2 XRD crystallography of phytosynthesized AgNPs showing four prominent peaks of a typical silver crystal\n\n\n\nThe remaining minor peaks are reflections of crystalline organic molecules adsorbed on the surface of the AgNPs. The XRD pattern obtained was consistent with earlier plant based synthesis reports (Murugan et al. 2014). The sizes of AgNPs were determined by estimating the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most prominent peaks from the XRD pattern using the Debye–Scherrer’s equation and the average crystallite size was 17 nm.\n\nTEM micrograph showed that the phytosynthesized AgNPs were small, monodisperse and spherical in shape which are in consistent with AFM image. The size of the AgNPs, as can be seen in the image ranged from 5 to 30 nm with an average of approximately 17 nm. These recorded particle size measurements are also in agreement with the estimated values from the AFM and XRD pattern. The SAED pattern (Fig. 3b) revealed distribution and crystalline nature of particles in the focusing zone.Fig. 3 TEM micrograph and SAED pattern of AgNPs. a TEM micrograph depicting uniformly dispersed spherical AgNPs. b SAED pattern revealing crystalline nature of AgNPs\n\n\n\nThe surface morphology of synthesized AgNPs can be better visualized and understood by their three dimensional topography. The AFM 3D image (Fig. 4a), of AgNPs depicts uniform spherical morphology and colloidal nature (Fig. 4b). The frequency of particles within the size range of 2.8 to 35 nm was much higher with an average of 17.396 nm, as shown in the particle size histogram (Fig. 4b). The sizes of the AgNPs are in agreement with TEM image and XRD pattern. This size range of particles could be due to capping of AgNPs by various compounds present in the flower bud extract. Previous studies have shown similar variation in size of the AgNPs (Nabikhan et al. 2010). The presence of elemental silver in the colloid was confirmed by the EDX peak pattern in silver region (Fig. 5).Fig. 4 AFM analysis of AgNPs. a AFM 3D image depicting spherical shape of AgNPs. b Histogram showing the size range of AgNPs\n\nFig. 5 EDX spectrum showing the presence of silver nano crystallite\n\n\n\nPhytochemical analysis by FTIR\nMetallic nanoparticles generated through phytosynthesis are generally stabilized by phytochemicals through molecular interaction with metal surfaces. The nature of molecular interactions can be studied using FTIR analysis and various capping agents were suggested based on the reference peaks of functional groups in the literature. As shown in (Fig. 6b), there were little changes in the spectrum of AgNPs compared with flower bud extract spectrum (Fig. 6a). The observed peaks in the flower bud extract (Fig. 6a) at 3740 for (O–H) alcohol, 1563 for (N–H) amide, 1181 and 1034 (C=O) for ether, and 2312 for (P–H) phosphine stretches were shifted (Fig. 6b) to lower wave numbers 3739 (OH), 1553 (N–H), 1029 (C=O) and 2309 (P–H) respectively in FTIR spectrum of AgNPs. Whereas, peak at 1316 for (C–N) amine stretch, shifted to higher wave number i.e., 1327 (C–N). There was disappearance of FTIR peak at 1449 for (C–H) alkane and appearance of new peak at 1512 for (N=O) Nitro stretch in FTIR spectrum of AgNPs. Similarity and subtle changes observed in FTIR spectrum of AgNPs compared to the FTIR spectrum of flower bud extract are owing to functional groups characteristic of phenolics, aromatic compounds, alcohols and proteins capping the AgNPs.Fig. 6 FTIR spectra. A Flower bud extract. B Stabilized AgNPs showing peaks indicating functional groups of phenolics, aromatic compounds, alcohols and proteins\n\n\n\nPhytochemicals with functional groups representing characteristic FTIR peaks namely phenols, flavonoids, stigmasterol and aliphatic hydrocarbons were reported from Couroupita guianensis flowers (Prabhu and Subban 2012; Rane et al. 2001; Wong and Tie 1995). Phenolic compounds are known to have high electron donating property which results in the formation of H radicals, which subsequently reduces silver ions (Ag+) to nano size (Ag0). The reduction function of polyphenols in the synthesis of AgNPs was also reported earlier (Dibrov et al. 2002). Phenolics posses hydroxyl and carboxyl groups and are able to bind to heavy metals.\n\nThe two peaks representing Amide-I are characteristic of proteins, which are responsible for reduction and stabilization of AgNPs, as reported earlier (Gole et al. 2001). The proteins bind to the AgNPs through the free amino group in cysteine residues (Sivaraman et al. 2009). FT-IR spectral characteristics of stabilized AgNPs and different sizes observed in TEM and AFM suggests several phytoconstituents like polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, and proteins are involved in the synthesis and stabilization of nanoparticles.\n\nPossible mechanism of AgNPs synthesis\nQuantitative analysis of flowers recorded high amount of quercetin (Prabhu and Subban 2012) and its high reduction potential was also reported (Zhang et al. 2011). It is thus possible that quercetin acts as a reducing agent and it is oxidized by AgNO3 resulting in the formation of silver nanoparticles. We therefore propose the overall reaction shown in (Fig. 7), involving reduction of Ag (I) to Ag (0) coupled with catechol oxidation and subsequent cross-linking of the corresponding quinone and quercetin. The redox reaction shown in the reaction scheme indicates the production of two protons per catechol.Fig. 7 Reduction reaction of silver ions to nanosilver by Quercetin\n\n\n\nAntibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles\nThe antibacterial activities of AgNPs, AgNO3, extract of flower buds and gentamicin against tested Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria were depicted as average values of inhibition zones (Table 1). The degree of sensitivity varied in relation to bacterial species and comparable with standard drug gentamicin under test concentration (Fig. 8).Table 1 Antibacterial activity of AgNO3, silver nanoparticles, flower buds extract and gentamicin\n\nBacterial strains\tZone of inhibition (mm)\t\nAgNo3 solution\tSilver nano solution\tFlower bud extract\tGentamicin\t\n Gram +ve\t\n Micrococcus luteus (MTCC-7256)\t15 ± 0.1**\t24 ± 0.8**\t15 ± 0.4**\t17 ± 0.6\t\n Bacillus subtilis (MTCC-1133)\t19 ± 0.3**\t23 ± 0.5**\t16 ± 0.2**\t30 ± 0.4\t\n Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC-7443)\t16 ± 0.6**\t17 ± 0.1**\t13 ± 0.1**\t18 ± 0.2\t\n Bacillus cereus (MTCC-4079)\t15 ± 0.7**\t20 ± 0.2**\t12 ± 0.2**\t16 ± 0.1\t\nGram −ve strains\t\n Escherichia coli (MTCC-1668)\t14 ± 0.1**\t20 ± 0.6**\t13 ± 0.1**\t32 ± 0.5\t\n Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 7296)\t13 ± 0.5**\t18 ± 0.4**\t11 ± 0.5**\t20 ± 0.3\t\n Salmonella typhimurium (MTCC-98)\t13 ± 0.2**\t17 ± 0.3**\t10 ± 0.3**\t30 ± 0.4\t\n Klebsiella pneumonia (MTCC-7028)\t15 ± 0.7**\t18 ± 0.1**\t13 ± 0.2**\t12 ± 0.1\t\nANOVA followed by Dennett’s test\n\n** P < 0.05\n\nFig. 8 Antibacterial activity of AgNPs on Gram positive and Gram negative strains. 1 AgNO3, 2 silver nano solution, 3 flower bud extract, 4 gentamicin, 5 sterile distilled water\n\n\n\nAgNPs showed strong inhibitory activity against four Gram positive bacterial species compared with AgNO3 and extract of flower buds. Maximum inhibition zone, i.e. 24 ± 0.8 mm was observed for Micrococcus luteus which is closely followed by Bacillus subtilis (23 ± 0.5) mm (Table 1). Moreover, for Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus cereus, AgNPs displayed higher bactericidal activity compared to gentamicin and were equally effective for Staphylococcus aureus. Notwithstanding, for B. subtilis, gentamicin showed significantly higher inhibition than AgNPs. Gram negative bacteria were also significantly inhibited by AgNPs when compared with AgNO3 and flower bud extract, while gentamicin displayed strong bactericidal activity against three Gram negative bacteria compared to AgNPs. Only Klebsiella pneumonia is less sensitive to gentamicin than AgNPs, AgNO3 and flower bud extract.\n\nEven though the antimicrobial activity of silver is well known for over a century, an exact mechanism of action was not yet elucidated. Many possible mechanisms were suggested in the literature that includes, disruption of proton gradient by binding to phospholipids associated with the proton pump of bacterial membranes (Sivaraman et al. 2009), DNA unwinding, inhibition of cell division, damage to bacterial cell envelopes and interaction with hydrogen bonding processes leading to a range of effects from inhibition of growth, loss of infectivity and cell death (Sathish Kumar et al. 2009).\n\nThe significant bactericidal activity of the flower bud extract against tested bacterial species is due to the presence of a number of antibacterial compounds like phenols, flavonoids, aromatic compounds, isatin and indirubin (Wong and Tie 1995). Varied mechanisms were suggested in the literature for the antibacterial activity of similar compounds reported from the blossoms of Couroupita. Plant phenolic compounds have a range of bioactivities like antibacterial, fungicidal, antiviral, antimutagenic and anti-inflammatory activities (Jayaraman et al. 2010), which are attributed to their disciple hydroxyl (OH) groups. Earlier reports of stigmasterol, aliphatic hydrocarbons and quercetin from flowers (Prabhu and Subban 2012; Rane et al. 2001), also support the observed antimicrobial activity of the extract. Phenolic compounds are known to inhibit enzymes through interaction with sulphahydral groups and proteins nonspecifically (Mason and Wasserman 1987). Quinine, the major plant phenolic compound complexes irreversibly with nucleophilic amino acids present in proteins, leading to inactivation and loss of their function (Stern et al. 1996). The most common targets are surface exposed adhesions, cell wall polypeptides and membrane bound enzymes. Quercitin, belongs to flavonoid class is known to curb E. coli gyrase B by binding to the ATP binding site (Plaper et al. 2003), to DNA and induce enzymic DNA damage (Austin et al. 1992). Quercitin also increases permeability of the bacterial inner membrane and loss of membrane potential (Mirzoeva et al. 1997). Multiple modes and overlapping action of these compounds present in the extract were responsible for the antimicrobial activity.\n\nThe enhanced antibacterial activity of phyto-chemically stabilized AgNPs is due to the combined effect of nanosilver form and associated antimicrobial plant compounds. This can be explained by the increased surface area to volume ratios in nanoparticles, which provides maximum contact area with bacteria. Hence, bactericidal property of the nanoparticles is size dependent, the larger the surface area, the greater the antibacterial activity (Jeong et al. 2005).\n\nSimilar to silver ions, a number of mechanisms were offered in the literature for the disinfectant activity of AgNPs. The proposed mechanisms include, depletion of intracellular ATP through destabilization of the outer membrane and rupture of the plasma membrane (Lok et al. 2006), blocking of respiration by reacting with sulfhydryl (–S–H) groups along the cell wall to form R–S–S–R bonds by the nanosilver causing bacterial cell death (Kumar et al. 2004; Morones et al. 2005). Further, on penetration AgNPs inflict more damage to bacteria by interacting with sulfur- and phosphorous-containing compounds like DNA (Sathish Kumar et al. 2009).\n\nThe phytochemicals are reported to have the capability of increasing the susceptibility of bacteria for various drugs (Jayaraman et al. 2010). For example, epigallocatechin gallate enhances the tetracycline action against resistant Staphylococcus isolates by impairment of tetracycline efflux pump activity and increased intracellular retention of the drug (Pal et al. 2007). In the present investigation the increased sensitivity of bacteria to the AgNPs is due to overlapping actions of silver and phytochemicals like quercetin, as they bind to the cell membrane, inhibition of enzymes, binding to proteins and DNA resulting in additive mode of action. Damage to the cell membrane by AgNPs was shown by TEM analysis (Pal et al. 2007). The difference in the antimicrobial activity of AgNPs between the Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria is due to the difference in molecular makeup of the cell walls. In the presence of lipopolysaccharide barrier in Gram negative bacteria general susceptibility is very low, as they get protection against toxins and chemicals. Higher sensitivity of Gram negative bacteria to gentamicin than AgNPs may be due to their differential mode of action, as the antibiotic inhibits protein synthesis, while silver failed to disrupt thick cell walls effectively. The difference in the antimicrobial activity of AgNPs among Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria may be due to species/strain variation in uptake, tolerance mechanism and general susceptibility. This is evident from the varying sensitivities of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus.\n\nThus, AgNPs fabricated by phytosynthetic methods enhance the low toxic potential of phytochemicals as antibacterial compounds and also reduce the maximum toxicity of silver on nontargets. Silver and phytochemical synergistic combinations in the form of nanoparticles have potential therapeutic value, as the antibacterial effect is achieved with a lower concentration of silver and phytochemicals. Overlapping and multiple mechanisms of bacteriostatic/bactericidal action of silver and phytochemicals certainly delay the emergence of resistance bacteria.\n\nConclusions\nThe phytochemicals, viz.

These groups of proteins share very low sequence and structural similarities among them, which consequently hamper their annotation using sequence similarity-based search methods. Alternatively the machine learning-based methods can become a suitable choice, but the optimal performance through machine learning-based methods is being affected by various factors such as class imbalance, incomplete learning, selection of inappropriate features, etc. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach to deal with the class imbalance problem by finding the optimal class distribution for enhancing the prediction accuracy for the RNA silencing suppressors. The optimal class distribution was obtained using different resampling techniques with varying degrees of class distribution starting from natural distribution to ideal distribution, i.e., equal distribution. The experimental results support the fact that optimal class distribution plays an important role to achieve near perfect learning. The best prediction results are obtained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) learning algorithm. We could achieve a sensitivity of 98.5 %, specificity of 92.6 % with an overall accuracy of 95.3 % on a tenfold cross validation and is further validated using leave one out cross validation test. It was also observed that the machine learning models trained on oversampled training sets using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) have relatively performed better than on both randomly undersampled and imbalanced training data sets. Further, we have characterized the important discriminatory sequence features of RNA-silencing suppressors which distinguish these groups of proteins from other protein families.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-016-0410-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nRNA silencingClass imbalance problemOptimal class distributionBalanced training setSMOTERandom undersamplingSVMRelieffissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nRNA silencing is a common host defense mechanism in plants against many plant RNA/DNA viruses (Li et al. 2014a; Pérez-Cañamás and Hernández 2014; Valli et al. 2001). To counter the RNA silencing defense mechanism, these plant viruses encode RNA-silencing suppressors, which disturb the host RNA silencing pathway. The molecular basis for the mechanism of encoding RNA-silencing suppressors by these plant viruses is still largely unknown. P1/HC–Pro of Potyviruses, P19 of tombusviruses and 2b proteins of cucumo-viruses are some of the well-studied RNA silencing suppressors (Qu and Morris 2005) and recently new RNA silencing suppressors are being identified in a mastrevirus (Wang et al. 2014) and in a wheat dwarf virus (Liu et al. 2014). Recent studies have also pointed to the role of suppressors in modulating the function of microRNAs (Chapman et al. 2004; Dunoyer et al. 2004).\n\nAnnotation of putative members of this family is hampered by the presence of high sequence diversity existing among these plant virus-encoded RNA-silencing suppressors (Qu and Morris 2005). The sequence similarity-based search methods like BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990) and PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al. 1997) have their inherent limitations in these situations where there exists low sequence conservation. Previously in (Jagga and Gupta 2014) the shortcomings of sequence similarity-based search methods like PSI-BLAST in correctly annotating the members of this protein family are emphasized. Machine learning methods trained on mathematically represented suitable input feature vectors become a viable alternative to sequence similarity-based search methods. Previously different machine learning methods have been successfully applied to solve biological classification tasks (Kumari et al. 2015; Nath et al. 2012; Nath and Subbiah 2014). But the true performance of machine learning methods is affected by various factors such as class imbalance (Nath and Subbiah 2015a), imperfect learning due to some missing example instances and selection of inappropriate input features.\n\nThe class imbalance problem is quite common in biological datasets, where there is a huge difference in the number of instances belonging to the different classes and subclasses. These types of imbalanced datasets result in classifier bias towards the majority class and tend to produce majority class classifier (Wei and Dunbrack 2013). In most of the cases, the class of interest is the minority class and is the cause for lower sensitivity. Many methods had been proposed to deal with the class imbalance problem. Previously it has been stressed that the natural class distribution may not be optimal for training (Lee 2014; Weiss and Provost 2003) and the requirement of a balanced training set for proper learning has been pointed out by Dunbrack et al. (Wei and Dunbrack 2013). In the current work, we propose a technique to achieve better learning of both the positive and negative classes by experimenting with different resampling methods to balance the dataset with varying degree of class distributions. We have also repeated the experiments on different machine learning algorithms on imbalanced, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) (Chawla et al. 2002) oversampled and randomly undersampled datasets to find the optimal class distribution. We used the sequence features like amino acid composition, property group composition, dipeptide counts and property group n-grams for creating the input feature vectors. Broadly, two types of approaches are used for handling the class imbalance, (1) resampling methods which are algorithm independent and are transferable to different machine learning algorithms and (2) internal approaches which involve altering the existing algorithms and its various parameters for adapting to imbalance class distribution. The SMOTE and random undersampling fall under resampling methods, although other sophisticated varieties of SMOTE exist (Barua et al. 2014; Han et al. 2005; Nakamura et al. 2013), but in the present study, we have limited our focus on simple undersampling and SMOTE oversampling as they are found to be useful for many classifiers (Blagus and Lusa 2013) and in many biological classification problems (Batuwita and Palade 2009; MacIsaac et al. 2006; Xiao et al. 2011).\n\nThe current method explored the possibility of improvement in prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithms using optimal class distribution and presented in detail the behavior of the tested learning algorithms with varying degrees of resampling. From the current work, it is also proved that prediction accuracy for the plant virus-encoded RNA-silencing suppressor proteins can be improved using resampling techniques.\n\nMaterials and methods\nDataset\nWe have used the dataset as used in (Jagga and Gupta 2014) which consisted of 208 plant virus-encoded RNA-silencing suppressor proteins (RSSPs) belonging to positive class and 1321 non-suppressor proteins (NSPs) belonging to negative class, for this study. The CD-HIT (Li and Godzik 2006) was applied separately to these classes of sequences to reduce the redundancy at 70 % sequence identity. Here, the positive class is the minority class as the number of positive class sequences is relatively very small when compared to the number of negative class sequences and their prediction will suffer from the imbalance class factor.\n\nExtraction of feature vectors\nThe quality of the attributes of the protein sequences selected for creating the input feature vector will have great influence in learning the concepts of a particular protein family. We represented each protein sequence as the combination of following sequence features to create input instances and they are explained below.\n\nAmino acid composition feature\nDifferent proteins are evolved through the avoidance and preference of some specific amino acids and leads to some certain unique set of percentage frequency composition, which can be used successfully for discriminatory purposes (Nath and Subbiah 2014). So we have taken the frequency percentage of distribution of the 20 amino acids along the length of the protein sequence as one of the features for creating the input feature vector. It is calculated using the following formula:\n\n 1 AAi=TCAA,iTCres,i×100, where AA denotes for one of the 20 amino acid residues, AAi denotes the amino acid percentage frequency of specific type ‘AA’ in the ith Sequence, TCAA,i denotes the total count of amino acid of specific ‘AA’ type in the ith sequence, TCres,i denotes the total count of all residues in the ith sequence (i.e., sequence length).\n\nAmino acid property group composition feature\nThe amino acids can be grouped according to their physicochemical properties. The Table 1 contains the list of amino acids belonging to the 11 different physicochemical groups. We have taken the percentage frequency composition of the 11 different amino acid property groups as used in (Nath et al. 2013) as the second feature. The formula for calculating this feature attribute is given below.Table 1 Physicochemical groupings of amino acids taken for the present study\n\nS. no.\tName of amino acid property group\tAmino acids in the specific group\t\n1.\tTiny amino acids group\tAla, Cys, Gly, Ser, Thr\t\n2.\tSmall amino acids group\tAla, Cys, Asp, Gly, Asn, Pro, Ser, Thr and Val\t\n3.\tAliphatic amino acids group\tIle, Leu and Val\t\n4.\tNonpolar amino acid groups\tAla, Cys, Phe, Gly, Ile, Leu, Met, Pro, Val, Trp and Tyr\t\n5.\tAromatic amino acid group\tPhe, His, Trp and Tyr\t\n6.\tPolar amino acid group\tAsp, Glu, His, Lys, Asn, Gln.

To take advantage of the local sequence order and amino acid coupling into the prediction we have taken the dipeptide counts as the third feature.\n\nProperty group n-grams\nTo take into the conservation of similar contiguous physicochemical amino acid property groups in the protein sequence, we have calculated the property groups n-grams, where n is the window length. In the current work we have taken the window length of 2 as the fourth feature and is calculated by the formula given below:\n\n 3 Physicochemical2-grams:Small=∑i=1N-1Ci,i+1, where N denotes the length of the protein sequence, i denotes the position of the amino acid residue along the protein sequence, if the condition (aai∈S∗and aai+1∈S∗) is true then C(i,i+1) = 1 else C(i,i+1) = 0 where the set of small aminoacids S* = {Ala,Cys,Asp,Gly,Asn,Pro,Ser,Thr,Val}.\n\nThe above formula is used to calculate physicochemical 2-grams for the small amino acid group. In the similar way the physicochemical 2-grams for the other ten physicochemical property groups were calculated. An example feature vector is provided in Supplementary Table S1–S3.\n\nOptimal balancing protocol\nSMOTE\nIt was proposed by Chawla et al. (2002) for intelligent oversampling of minority samples as opposed to random oversampling, which may bias the learning towards the overrepresented samples. It is a nearest neighbor-based method, where it first chooses k nearest samples for a particular minority sample. It then randomly selects the j minority samples to create a synthetic minority sample. Successful use of SMOTE in classification tasks have been shown in (Li et al. 2014b; Nath and Subbiah 2015b; Suvarna Vani and Durga Bhavani 2013).\n\nClassification protocol SVM\nSupport vector machines are supervised learning algorithms and are based on statistical learning theory of Vapnik (Vapnik 1995, 1998). Previous usage of SVM for biological classification/prediction problems has found them to be more accurate and also they are robust to noise and well suited for high dimensional datasets (Kandaswamy et al. 2011; Mishra et al. 2014; Pugalenthi et al. 2010). We have used the sequential minimization optimization (SMO) (Platt 1999) algorithm for fast training of SVM with polynomial kernel with an exponent value of 1 and C = 1 (a complexity parameter which SMO uses to build the hyperplane between the two classes, -C governs softness of the class margins).\n\nAll the experiments were carried out using WEKA (Hall et al. 2009) which is an open source java-based machine learning platform. The schematic representation of the current methodology is given in Fig. 1.Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the current pipeline\n\n\n\nCharacterization of plant virus-encoded RNA-silencing suppressors\nWe have used Relieff (Kira and Rendell 1992) feature ranking algorithm to rank the sequence features according to their discriminating ability. Relieff is a nearest neighbor-based feature relevance algorithm. It starts by randomly selecting an instance and then searches for the nearest neighboring instances belonging to the same and opposite classes. It compares the attributes of the instance with its nearest neighbors and assigns weights according to its discriminating ability.\n\nPerformance evaluation metrics\nWe have used stratified tenfold cross validation for the evaluation of the various models. The performances of the machine learning algorithms were assessed with both threshold-dependent and threshold-independent parameters. These parameters are derived from the values of the confusion matrix, namely TP: true positive that is the number of correctly predicted RSSPs, TN: true negative that is the number of correctly predicted NSPs, FP: false positive that is the number of incorrectly predicted NSPs and FN: false negative that is the number of incorrectly predicted RSSPs. The formula for calculating the evaluation parameters are given below:\n\nSensitivity Expresses the percentage of correctly predicted RSSPs. 4 Sensitivity=TPTP+FN×100. \n\nSpecificity Expresses the percentage of correctly predicted NSPs. 5 Specificity=TNTN+FP×100. \n\nAccuracy Expresses the percentage of both correctly predicted RSSPs and NSPs. 6 Accuracy=TP+TNTP+FP+TN+FN×100. \n\nAUC Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve that summarizes the ROC by a single numerical value. It is a threshold-independent metric and can take values from 0 to 1 (Bradley 1997). The value of 0 indicates the worst case, 0.5 for random ranking and 1 indicates the best prediction.\n\nYouden’s Index This performance metric evaluates the algorithm’s ability to avoid failure. Lower failure rates are expressed by higher index values (Youden 1950). It is calculated as: 7 Y=Sensitivity-1-Specificity. \n\nDominance It expresses the relationship between the TP_rate (true-positive rate) and TN_rate (true-negative rate) and is proposed by (García et al. 2009). It is calculated as: 8 Dominance=TP_rate-TN_rate. \n\nIts value ranges from −1 to +1. A dominance value of +1 means a perfect accuracy on the positive class and a value −1 means a perfect accuracy on the negative class. A value closer to zero means a balance between TP_rate and TN_rate.\n\ng-mean: it was proposed by Kubat et al. (1997), this evaluation parameter shows the balance between sensitivity and specificity. It is the geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity. It is calculated as: 9 g-means=Sensitivity×Specificity. \n\nResults and discussion\nWe have experimented with four different machine learning algorithms, namely—(1) naive Bayes (NB), (2) Fischer linear discriminant function (implemented as FLDA in WEKA), (3) support vector machines with sequential minimization optimization (SMO) and (4) K nearest neighbor (implemented as IBK in WEKA) on the imbalanced dataset (original), randomly undersampled dataset (with varying class distribution) and SMOTE oversampled dataset (with varying class distribution) to find the optimal class distribution for each of these classifiers.\n\nLearning performance on imbalanced dataset\nObserving the values of the performance evaluation parameters obtained from the different machine learning algorithms when trained with the imbalanced dataset (Table 2), the overall accuracy of SMO and IBK crossed above 90 %, although with a large difference in their individual accuracies for the positive (sensitivity) and negative classes (specificity), respectively. The training on the imbalanced dataset resulted in high specificity values for all the learning algorithms except the naive Bayes. The negative dominance values of all the learning algorithms (except the naive Bayes) are also biased towards the TN_rate. This indicates that optimal learning with higher accuracies (sensitivity and specificities) for the positive and negative classes is difficult in cases where there is an imbalance between the positive and negative class instances.Table 2 Performance evaluation metrics of the different learning algorithms trained on the imbalanced datasets\n\nLearning algorithms\tSensitivity\tSpecificity\tAccuracy\tAUC\tYouden’s Index\tDominance\t\ng-means\t\nImbalanced data set\t\n NB\t90.8\t29.2\t36.9\t0.678\t0.200\t0.616\t51.49\t\n FLDA\t64.7\t84.9\t82.3\t0.819\t0.492\t−0.202\t74.1\t\n SMO\t52.1\t97.1\t91.4\t0.746\t0.496\t−0.450\t71.1\t\n IBK\t68.9\t97.0\t93.4\t0.841\t0.659\t−0.281\t81.7\t\n\n\nLearning performance on randomly undersampled datasets\nNearest neighbor-based IBK method performed better than all the other machine learning algorithms and closely followed by SMO, when the original imbalance dataset was subjected to undersampling at different distribution rates for dealing with the data imbalance problem. The values of different performance evaluation parameters obtained by different degrees of class distribution are recorded in the Table 3. When the dataset is fully balanced by undersampling (undersampled 1:1), we obtained higher accuracy for the positive class samples than all other undersampled datasets. Highest overall accuracy of 91.8 % is obtained by IBK when the undersampling rate is 1:5 closely followed by SMO with 89.4 % accuracy. In the case of the undersampling datasets, IBK performed better than all other machine learning algorithms.Table 3 Performance evaluation metrics of the different machine learning algorithms trained on the different randomly undersampled training sets\n\nLearning algorithms\tSensitivity\tSpecificity\tAccuracy\tAUC\tYouden’s Index\tDominance\t\ng-means\t\nUndersampling (1:1) (fully balanced) training set\t\n NB\t91.6\t23.5\t57.6\t0.631\t0.151\t0.681\t46.3\t\n FLDA\t73.9\t68.5\t71.4\t0.768\t0.424\t0.054\t71.1\t\n SMO\t77.3\t74.8\t76.1\t0.761\t0.521\t0.025\t76.0\t\n IBK\t80.7\t81.5\t81.1\t0.818\t0.622\t−0.008\t81.5\t\nUndersampling (1:2) training set\t\n NB\t89.1\t30.3\t49.9\t0.666\t0.194\t0.588\t51.9\t\n FLDA\t63.0\t63.0\t63.0\t0.661\t0.26\t0\t63\t\n SMO\t72.3\t88.7\t83.2\t0.805\t0.61\t−0.164\t80.08\t\n IBK\t72.3\t90.8\t84.6\t0.809\t0.631\t−0.185\t81.0\t\nUndersampling (1:3) training set\t\n NB\t90.8\t28.9\t44.3\t0.664\t0.197\t0.619\t51.2\t\n FLDA\t58.8\t55.7\t56.5\t0.613\t0.507\t0.031\t57.2\t\n SMO\t67.2\t91.9\t85.7\t0.796\t0.591\t−0.247\t78.5\t\n IBK\t72.3\t93.0\t87.8\t0.082\t0.653\t−0.207\t81.9\t\nUndersampling (1:4) training set\t\n NB\t88.2\t31.1\t42.5\t0.694\t0.193\t0.571\t52.37\t\n FLDA\t64.7\t73.5\t71.8\t0.731\t0.382\t−0.088\t68.9\t\n SMO\t63.0\t92.4\t86.6\t0.777\t0.554\t−0.294\t76.2\t\n IBK\t68.9\t94.7\t89.6\t0.823\t0.636\t−0.258\t80.7\t\nUndersampling (1:5) training set\t\n NB\t89.1\t31.1\t40.8\t0.692\t0.202\t0.58\t52.6\t\n FLDA\t66.4\t79.0\t76.9\t0.791\t0.454\t−0.126\t72.42\t\n SMO\t57.1\t94.6\t88.4\t0.759\t0.61\t−0.375\t73.4\t\n IBK\t70.6\t93.9\t90.1\t0.841\t0.645\t−0.233\t81.4\t\nUndersampling (1:6) training set\t\n NB\t89.1\t29.6\t38.1\t0.688\t0.187\t0.595\t51.3\t\n FLDA\t68.1\t80.4\t78.6\t0.805\t0.485\t−0.123\t73.9\t\n SMO\t56.3\t95.0\t89.4\t0.756\t0.513\t−0.387\t73.13\t\n IBK\t71.4\t95.2\t91.8\t0.824\t0.666\t−0.238\t82.4\t\n\n\nLearning performance on SMOTE oversampled datasets\nSMO performed better than all the other machine learning algorithms closely followed by FLDA on SMOTE oversampled datasets. The values of different performance parameters are recorded in the Table 4. One of the best noticeable effects of oversampling is the immediate increase in sensitivity values for all the four machine learning algorithms. There is a regular increasing trend for the Youden’s Index (which shows the model’s ability to avoid faults) with increasing rate of SMOTE oversampling. The best trade-off for the different evaluation parameters was obtained for the SMOTE 500 % dataset with SMO as the machine learning algorithm. This particular training dataset gave the best performance evaluation metrics with SMO as the learning algorithm. With this training dataset we could achieve 98.5 % sensitivity, 92.6 % specificity, 95.3 % overall accuracy, and 0.955 of AUC. A high value of sensitivity indicates that the model is very accurate for the positive minority class samples. A positive dominance index of 0.059 also confirms the fact that the model is good in predicting minority samples. A high value of the Youden’s Index (0.911) indicates the model’s superiority in fault avoidance ability. A g-means value of 95.5 also indicates an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity. ROC plots for the four different machine learning algorithms trained on the best performing training set (SMOTE oversampled 500 % dataset) are shown in Fig. 2.Table 4 Performance evaluation metrics of the different machine learning algorithms trained on the different SMOTE oversampled training sets\n\nLearning Algorithms\tSensitivity\tSpecificity\tAccuracy\tAUC\tYouden’s Index\tDominance\t\ng-means\t\nSMOTE 100 % training set\t\n NB\t91.2\t33.1\t46.1\t0.738\t0.243\t0.581\t54.9\t\n FLDA\t81.5\t84.5\t83.8\t0.896\t0.660\t−0.030\t82.9\t\n SMO\t81.1\t94.7\t91.6\t0.879\t0.758\t−0.136\t87.6\t\n IBK\t97.9\t85.1\t88.0\t0.912\t0.830\t0.128\t91.2\t\nSMOTE 200 % training set\t\n NB\t91.6\t35.0\t52.1\t0.749\t0.266\t0.566\t56.6\t\n FLDA\t91.3\t85.4\t87.2\t0.934\t0.767\t0.005\t88.3\t\n SMO\t92.4\t93.9\t93.5\t0.932\t0.863\t−0.015\t93.1\t\n IBK\t98.9\t79.7\t85.5\t0.894\t0.786\t0.192\t88.7\t\nSMOTE 300 % training set\t\n NB\t91.2\t36.0\t56.1\t0.751\t0.272\t0.552\t57.2\t\n FLDA\t95.2\t84.4\t88.3\t0.946\t0.796\t0.108\t89.6\t\n SMO\t96.2\t92.3\t93.7\t0.942\t0.885\t0.003\t94.2\t\n IBK\t99.4\t79.1\t86.5\t0.890\t0.785\t0.203\t88.6\t\nSMOTE 400 % training set\t\n NB\t90.9\t36.9\t56.1\t0.751\t0.278\t0.54\t57.9\t\n FLDA\t95.8\t84.9\t89.4\t0.952\t0.807\t0.109\t90.1\t\n SMO\t96.5\t91.8\t93.7\t0.941\t0.883\t0.047\t94.1\t\n IBK\t99.3\t74.6\t84.9\t0.870\t0.733\t0.247\t86.0\t\nSMOTE 500 % training set\t\n NB\t92.0\t36.8\t62.4\t0.745\t0.288\t0.552\t58.1\t\n FLDA\t97.3\t83.7\t90.0\t0.962\t0.810\t0.136\t90.2\t\n SMO\t98.5\t92.6\t95.3\t0.955\t0.911\t0.059\t95.5\t\n IBK\t99.6\t73.8\t85.8\t0.867\t0.734\t0.258\t85.7\t\nSMOTE 594 % (fully balanced) training set\t\n NB\t92.4\t36.4\t64.4\t0.742\t0.288\t0.56\t57.9\t\n FLDA\t97.7\t85.1\t91.4\t0.964\t0.828\t0.12\t91.1\t\n SMO\t97.9\t90.8\t94.4\t0.944\t0.887\t0.071\t94.2\t\n IBK\t99.6\t73.5\t86.6\t0.862\t0.731\t0.261\t85.5\t\nFig. 2 ROC curves of the four classifiers using the training set with optimal class distribution [SMOTE (500 %)]\n\n\n\nTo further validate the learned models trained on a SMOTE oversampled dataset (500 %), we have used leave on out cross validation test (Chou and Zhang 1995). It is deemed as the most objective and robust test and has been used by many researchers for the assessment of classifier models (Chou and Cai 2004; Gao et al. 2005; Xie et al. 2013), the results are given in Table 5.Table 5 Leave on out cross validation performance evaluation metrics on the best training set\n\nLearning algorithms\tSensitivity\tSpecificity\tAccuracy\tAUC\tYouden’s Index\tDominance\t\ng-means\t\nLOOCV on SMOTE (500 %)\t\n NB\t92.3\t36.4\t62.3\t0.745\t0.287\t0.559\t57.96\t\n FLDA\t97.2\t85.1\t90.7\t0.966\t0.823\t0.121\t90.90\t\n SMO\t98.9\t92.3\t95.3\t0.956\t0.912\t0.066\t95.50\t\n IBK\t99.4\t75.8\t86.8\t0.876\t0.752\t0.236\t86.80\t\n\n\nFurther, a corrected resampled paired t test was performed using WEKA with SMO as the baseline classifier. The t test was performed at the 5 % significance level. Each tenfold cross validation was repeated ten times (10 × 10 runs for each algorithm). Percentage correctly predicted instances, AUC, TP rate and TN rate was used for comparison with t test. The results of the t test are provided in the supplementary material (Table S4a–d).\n\nComparing the results with previous study\nWe have compared the evaluation metric of the current study with the previous study and the performance evaluation metric values for the current best training set and the previously reported values are presented in Table 6.Table 6 Comparison of the performance evaluation metrics of the current work with the previous methods\n\nMethods\tSensitivity\tSpecificity\tAccuracy\tAUC\tYouden’s Index\tDominance\t\ng-means\t\nJagga and Gupta (2014)\t80.90\t80.57\t80.61\t0.910\t0.614\t0.003\t80.70\t\nSMO [SMOTE (500 %)]\t98.50\t92.60\t95.30\t0.955\t0.911\t0.059\t95.50\t\n\n\nOn comparison with the previous method, the current SMOTE (500 %) model achieved far better performance evaluation metrics.\n\nIt is also observed that both the SMOTE oversampling and random undersampling have least effect on the performance of the naive Bayes algorithm, a similar observation has also been made by (Daskalaki et al. 2006).\n\nCharacterization of RNA-silencing suppressors using sequence-based features\nIn Fig. 3, we have plotted the heat map representation of the sequence attributes except the dipeptides. Figure 4 presents the heat map representation of the dipeptides. The color bar in both the figures (on the right side of both the figures) shows the color intensity proportional to the feature ranking scores which are calculated according to their discriminating ability. Observing the Fig. 3, arginine, polar and nonpolar property groups are the most useful discriminatory features. From Fig. 4, it can also be observed that DF, SF, NN, DT, CW, CG are the most discriminatory dipeptides.Fig. 3 Heat map representation of ranking the sequence features (excluding dipeptides) according to their discriminative ability\n\nFig. 4 Heat map representation of ranking the dipeptides according to their discriminative ability\n\n\n\nArginines are relatively important in binding sites (Barnes 2007), also it is imperative to mention the importance of the role of arginine in suppressor activity of PRS suppressor (2b) of a cucumber mosaic virus strain (CM95R) (Goto et al. 2007) where it facilitates in binding to RNA and in potato virus M where mutational studies have shown the importance of arginines in suppression activity (Senshu et al. 2011). The importance of nonpolar amino acids, specifically isoleucine in suppression activity is also emphasized in (Carr and Pathology 2007).\n\nConclusions\nMachine learning-based approaches are apposite techniques when compared to sequence alignment-based methods for the prediction of plant virus-encoded RNA-silencing suppressors and can become the superior alternative if the imbalance dataset problem is properly resolved. The protein family classification problem intrinsically presents a class imbalance situation, where the class of interest is a particular protein family which constitutes the positive class and the rest of the protein families belonging to the negative classes. Naturally, there is a large difference between the number of instances belonging to positive and negative classes. Depending on the mathematical representation of the protein sequences, machine learning-based approaches can capture the hidden relationship among the calculated protein attributes, which is most of the times better than alignment-based methods for protein classification. The plant virus-encoded RNA-silencing suppressor protein classification presents a data imbalance problem; we compared the learning of different machine learning algorithms on imbalanced, SMOTE oversampled and randomly undersampled datasets. The results reported in this study showed that learning is non-optimal for imbalanced positive and negative class data sets. The behavior of the machine learning algorithms is different in SMOTE oversampling and random undersampling. IBK performed better on randomly undersampled datasets, while the performance of SMO is superior to all other machine learning algorithms on SMOTE oversampled datasets. Better performance evaluation metrics were obtained on SMOTE oversampled datasets than on the randomly undersampled datasets. The best model is achieved with SMOTE oversampling when SMO is used as the learning algorithm. This also points to the fact that the full (ideal) balancing between the positive and negative classes may not fully eliminate the classifier bias. The current study supports and provides evidence to the fact that the learning of different machine learning algorithms can be improved using an optimal class distribution and also the fully balanced class distribution need not be optimal for the training of the learning algorithms. Individual accuracies and learning on the positive and negative classes can be increased by changing the class distribution. Overall the performance of the various machine learning algorithms on SMOTE oversampled datasets is better than the random undersampled datasets. Further, we have ranked the calculated sequence features according to their discriminating ability in classifying plant virus-encoded RNA-silencing suppressors from non-suppressors. The current pipeline can be successfully applied to other protein family classification problem with different degrees of imbalance. The current method explored the possibility of improvement in prediction accuracy of the four machine learning algorithms using an optimal class distribution that provides the best trade-off between imbalance dataset and the diversity of the dataset. A comprehensive study was carried out and presented in detail the behavior of the tested learning algorithms with varying degrees of resampling. It is also proved that prediction accuracy for the plant virus suppressor proteins can be improved using the optimal class distribution ratio.\n\nFuture research can be carried out by incorporating additional diversifying techniques to deal with the related problem of incomplete learning. More sophisticated techniques can be evolved to deal with the trade-off between the balancing factor and input instance diversity. Further research in this direction can lead to the formulation of some kind of standard in creating benchmark data sets to every specific biological problem.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOCX 19 kb)\n\n \n\nThe authors are very grateful to Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Banaras Hindu University for supports in this study.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interests.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAltschul SF  Gish W  Miller W  Myers EW  Lipman DJ   Basic local alignment search tool J Mol Biol 1990 215 403 410 10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80360-2 2231712 \nAltschul S  Madden T  Schaffer A  Zhang J  Zhang Z  Miller W  Lipman D   Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs Nucleic Acids Res 1997 25 3389 3402 10.1093/nar/25.17.3389 9254694 \nBarnes MR (2007) Bioinformatics for geneticists: a bioinformatics primer for the analysis of genetic data.

Thermodynamic parameters, Ea, ΔH°, ΔS° and ΔG°, have found to be 62.15, −67.95, −0.068 and −20.05 kJ mol−1 according to the Coats–Redfern equation. Analysis of interaction of 1 with BSA protein was done by using the UV–Vis and FTIR spectroscopic methods. The observed binding constants was 1.12 (±0.09) × 104 M−1. The biological effect of 1 was checked on different plant growth-promoting (PGPR) strains such as Rhizobiumleguminosarum, Pseudomonasfluorescens, Arthrobactercitreus, Bacillusbrevis and Salmonellatyphimurium and compared with parent molecule acephate where 1 has shown less toxicity against PGPRs as compared to acephate. The experimental results for geometric parameters and values of peak position in IR spectra have found to match excellently with the computational studies performed by GAMESS software package. Theoretically, twelve new analogs of 1 were prepared and their comparative reactivity (HOMO–LUMO energy) and biodecomposition (on the basis of polarizability) is discussed.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-015-0313-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nAcephatePhenylhydrazineThermal analysisPlant growth-promoting traitsUniversity Grant Commission-IndiaRGNF-SC-HIM-1223Kumar Vijay issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nAll the contaminants including insecticides, nematodes and herbicides applied to crops reach to soil and influence the soil fertility by inhibiting the soil’s microorganisms. Moreover, plant protection has become necessary in order to increase the food production, and therefore, multiple and over use of pesticides are called necessary evil (David 1998; Krämer 2007; Prasad et al. 2013; Wasim et al. 2009). Pesticides are considered to be an integral part of modern agriculture. So the topics such as green decomposition, production of less toxic and green pesticides are the prime most requirements of current era.\n\nAcephate is an important and cheapest organophosphorus insecticide used worldwide (Kumar et al. 2015a). In last 5 years, every year 10 % increase in production of technical grade acephate was observed (Kumar et al. 2015a). It was registered to control a wide range of insects on various agricultural crops. The insecticidal potency of acephate is due to the inhibition of acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) activity (Kumar et al. 2013a, 2015a). It is toxic in various components of the environment and further decomposed into highly toxic methamidophos (Kumar et al. 2015a). Hence, the safe decomposition and preparation of less toxic analog of acephate are an important issue from the environmental concern.\n\nMoreover, phenylhydrazine is classified among the aromatic nucleophile. It acts as an intermediate of various active compounds (Chen et al. 2014; Rosamilia et al. 2008). As per our best information, there is no reported data about the interactions of phenylhydrazine with acephate. Accordingly, the present study (in vitro) was initiated to investigate the ability of phenylhydrazine to decompose/neutralize the toxic effect of acephate and synthesis of green pesticide.\n\nExperimental\nMaterials\nAcephate technical grade (>90 %) was supplied by Gautmi Ltd., Andhra Pradesh, India. All the materials and solvents employed in synthesis were of extra-pure grade and used after further purification. Pure cultures of the strains, namely Rhizobiumleguminosarum (NCIM-2749), Pseudomonasfluorescens (NCIM-5096), Arthrobactercitreus (NCIM-2320), Bacillusbrevis (NCIM-2532) and Salmonellatyphimurium (NCIM-2501), were purchased from National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India.\n\nChemistry\nDecomposition/synthesis procedure\nAn environment-friendly one-step method was designed and followed where equimolar aqueous solution of acephate (0.018 g in 10 mL/0.01 M) mixed with one molar aqueous solution of phenylhydrazine (0.011 g in 10 mL/0.01 M) in a beaker. Solution of the beaker was stirred for 1 h at room temperature (RT) at pH 3 and kept for 7 days in the presence of normal light at RT and pH 3 (maintained by using HCl). Fine amorphous white-colored product (1) was obtained, which was washed with hot water, methanol and dried overnight at 45 °C and allowed for spectral, thermal, BSA binding and plant growth-promoting activities.\n\nBiology\nPlant growth-promoting activities\nAs mentioned above, entire pollutants including insecticides, nematodes and herbicides applied to crops reach to soil and influence soil fertility by inhibiting the soil’s microorganisms. Hence, the study of the effect of newly synthesized molecule was seen on PGPR strains. In the current study, the plant growth-promoting activities, namely siderophore production, indole acetic acid production, hydrogen cyanide production and phosphate solubilization, were checked with above-mentioned strains (Kumar et al. 2015b). All the activities were preformed in triplicates, and results were analyzed by using the ANOVA statistical analysis.\n\nPreparation of stock solution and interaction of 1 with BSA\nBovine serum albumin (40 mg/mL or 0.5 mM) was dissolved in aqueous solution containing phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 36,500 M−1 cm−1 at 275 nm (Painter et al. 1998). Solutions of 1 were first prepared in phosphate buffer/ethanol (50 %) and then diluted by serial dilution to 0.010, 0.0075, 0.0050, 0.0025, 0.00125 mM in the same phosphate buffer.\n\nThe absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 1800S double-beam spectrophotometer, using a slit of 5 nm; quartz cuvettes of 1 cm and scan speed of 250 nm min−1 were used. The UV–Vis absorptions of BSA in the presence and absence of 1 were measured at pH 7.2 by keeping the concentration of BSA constant (0.05 mM), while varying the concentration of 1 (0.010, 0.0075, 0.0050, 0.0025, 0.00125 mM), in the range of 230–400 nm. The binding constants of the drugs–BSA complexes were calculated as reported (mathematical detail is stated in Supplementary Information S3) (Abdi et al. 2012; Connors 1987).\n\nFTIR spectroscopy measurements\nInfrared measurement was taken at room temperature on a Shimadzu 8400S FTIR spectrometer, equipped with KBr beam splitter. FTIR study was performed as described by Abdi et al. (2012). Solution of 1 was added dropwise to the protein solution with constant stirring to ensure the formation of homogeneous solution. Interferograms were accumulated over the spectral range 4000–400 cm−1 with a nominal resolution of 4 cm−1 and 50 scans. At first, spectra of buffer (phosphate pH 7.4) and protein solution were collected on the same conditions. Then, buffer spectrum is subtracted from the spectra of sample solution to get the FTIR spectra of protein. The difference spectra [(protein solution + molecule solution) + (protein solution)] were generated using the polypeptide antisymmetric and symmetric C–H stretching bands located at 2900–2800 cm−1, as internal standard. These bands, which are due to protein C–H stretching vibrations, do not undergo any spectral changes (shifting or intensity variation) upon any interaction with drug, and therefore, they are commonly used as internal standard. When producing difference spectra, these bands were adjusted to the baseline level, in order to normalize difference spectra.\n\nComputational study\nThe theoretical, geometric parameters (bond lengths and bond angles, Huckel charge densities), polarizability, HOMO–LUMO energy difference and infrared intensities of the product in the ground state were calculated using HF method with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set for the first time. Entire analysis was performed by GAMESS program package (Aihara 1999; Kumar et al. 2015c, d). The motive of the computational study was to assist and cross-check the experimental study and vice versa. Additional motive was to obtain the data such as steric energy, chemical reactivity, biodecomposition, Huckel charge densities, bond angles and bond length which are not experimentally obtained.\n\nResults and discussions\nChemistry\nStructure illustration\nThe observed values of absorption maxima (λmax) for 1 in UV–Vis spectra were 269 nm (due to n → π* transitions) and 456 nm (due to π → π* transitions). By comparing the UV–Vis spectra of acephate with product (Fig. 1), it was observed that 1 contains an organic chromophoric group that leads to increase in wavelength as well as absorption. Comparatively, no sharp absorption maxima (λmax) were observed in the case of acephate even in UV region. Here, UV–Vis spectra clearly indicate the formation of product due to bond formation of phenylhydrazine with acephate.Fig. 1 UV–Vis spectra of 1 and of acephate\n\n\n\nOn comparison of IR spectra of acephate (IR spectra) and phenylhydrazine to 1, new peak was observed at 3650 cm−1 that corresponds to stretching frequencies of free O–H of water. Broadening and shifting were observed in the stretching frequencies of N–H (3500–3300 cm−1) of phenylhydrazine and acephate. A new peak at 2190 cm−1 was observed due to stretching vibration of C=N=N type allene system. Redshift in the stretching band of C=N group of 1 (1630 cm−1) compared to phenylhydrazine (1900 cm−1) was observed. The ν(C=O) stretching band of acephate disappears in 1 that indicates removal of carbonyl group from acephate on attack of phenylhydrazine for the formation of 1. Broad peak at 1500 cm−1 in 1 belongs to the stretching frequencies of C=C. Association of P=O oxygen with hydrogen atom of water molecule was observed in terms of broadening and increase in intensity of P–O stretching band (850 cm−1) (Fig. 2). The frequency for N–H out of plane was observed at 700 cm−1 in broad and intense form (Kumar et al. 2013a, b; Silberstein et al. 2005).Fig. 2 FTIR spectrum of acephate, phenylhydrazine and 1\n\n\n\n\nCompound 1 displayed molecular ion peak at m/z 227.3 with relative abundance of 100 %, which is in excellent agreement with the structure shown in Fig. 3a. Hundred percentage intensity at 227.3 confirms the formation of a stable moiety N′-phenyl-thiophosphorohydrazidic acid O,S-dimethyl ester. Some other observed fragments with approximate intensity were at m/z = 159.4 (35 %) and 91.4 (40 %), respectively. In the fragmentation of 1, no peak was observed at around m/z = 141, indicating that decomposition of 1 to methamidophos is improbable. 31P-NMR signals at 27.13 ppm were assigned to the P–O–CH3 and P–S–CH3 groups of acephate. Upward shift at 2.88 and −5.88 ppm was observed in 1 as compared to acephate due to two different arrangements of –S–CH3 and –O–CH3 around phosphate atoms (Kumar et al. 2013a; Silberstein et al. 2005). It means both the signal showed downshift (10 and 12 times) with decrease in intensity (2 and 3 times) as compared to acephate (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3 Mass (ESI–MS), 31P-NMR and thermal study (TGA) of acephate and 1. a Mass analysis of 1, b\n31P NMR spectra of 1 and of acephate, c thermal study of acephate and d thermal study of 1\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of water molecules in 1 was confirmed by the thermal study. Higher activation energy for thermal decomposition of 1 was observed (62.15 kJ/mol) as compared to acephate (9.54 kJ/mol) (Fig. 3c, d; Table 1). Thermal analysis (TGA) showed formation of stable new adduct as compared to parent acephate. In thermal analysis, it was observed that product 1 decomposed at higher temperature (698 K) (Table 1) as compared to acephate (450 K).Table 1 Kinetic parameters of the acephate and 1 (for detail, see Supplementary Information S4)\n\nMoiety\tMain step\tThermodynamic parameters by TG/DTG analysis\t\n\nT\np (K)\t\nA (min−1)\tEa (kJ/mol)\tΔH (kJ/mol)\tΔS (kJ/mol)\tΔG (kJ/mol)\t\nr\n2\n\t\nAcephate 1\n\t1st\t450\t9.1 × 1019\n\t9.54\t5.79\t0.167\t−69.36\t0.98\t\n2nd\t698\t6.3 × 107\n\t62.15\t−67.95\t−0.068\t−20.04\t0.96\t\n\n\nMechanism\nThe final structure of 1 was confirmed by FTIR, 31P-NMR, mass and thermal analysis data as sated above. Nucleophilic substitution reaction by attack of nucleophile phenylhydrazine (:NH2–NH–) to acephate is responsible for the formation of product 1. Both phosphate phosphorus and carbonyl carbon are electron deficient but because of more electropositive character of phosphorus, nucleophile attack on it leads to displacement of acetamide (Chen et al. 2014; Rosamilia et al. 2008) (Scheme 1).\nScheme 1 Synthesis scheme of 1\n\n\n\n\nBiology\nPlant growth-promoting activities\nEffect of 1 on plant growth-promoting strains was performed to check its toxic/negative effect compared to acephate at their different concentration levels, i.e., 25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/L. Effect on inhibition of siderophores production by acephate and 1 was determined on King’s B (KB) medium using the literature reported method (Yasmin et al. 2009). Huge inhibition difference was obtained between acephate (more toxic) and 1 (less toxic) (Ahemada and Kibret 2014). The siderophore production was reduced significantly (p ≤ 0.05) in acephate compared to 1 (and is shown by notation acephate: 1). At 25 µg/L, inhibition of plant growth-promoting strain compared to control was found by 30:17 % and 80:55 % over control was obtained at 200 µg/L (Table 2). Exact siderophore production by different bacteria in the presence of 1 was found in order: B.brevis > R.leguminosarum > S.typhimurium > A.citreus = P.fluorescens (supplementary Figure S2).Table 2 Plant growth-promoting activities of acephate and 1\n\n\nStrain code\tConc.

Among all strains at significant level (p ≤ 0.05), B.brevis produced less phosphate solubilization (hole in mm) in the presence of 1. Exact order of phosphate solubilization was found to be R.leguminosarum > P.fluorescens > A.citreus > S.typhimurium > B.brevis (supplementary Figure S3).\n\nRhizobacteria produce HCN to protect the growing plants from pathogen attack by direct killing of parasites (Ahemada and Kibret 2014). In this study, three concentrations of each acephate and 1 did affect negatively HCN synthesis, but very low effect of 1 was analyzed. In case of acephate, only two strains (A.citreus, B.brevis) were found to produce HCN (supplementary Fig. S4), while in the presence of 1 all strains (R.leguminosarum, P.fluorescens, A.citreus, B.brevis and S.typhimurium) produced HCN (Table 2).\n\nIn the medium, where acephate and 1 was not supplied, all strains produced indole acetic acid (IAA) in significant amount (p ≤ 0.05). But, on comparison with acephate, 1 was producing higher concentration of IAA (Table 2). Among all strains at significant level (p ≤ 0.05), S.typhimurium produced lowest amount of IAA in the presence of 1 compared to other strains and order of IAA production was: A.citreus > B.brevis > R.leguminosarum > P.fluorescens > S.typhimurium. It is worthy to mention that acephate shows inhibitory effect on plant growth-promoting strains even at small concentrations. It could disrupt the bacterial community due to differences in sensitivity between microorganisms. Any modification of the environment which leads to a response by living organisms may be considered as a stress (Kumar et al. 2015a; Missous et al. 2007). The biotic stress observed in biology, is considered a global phenomenon, and can be extended to anthropogenic pressure such as genetic engineering or xenobiotic (including pesticides) pollution (Kumar et al. 2014; Thammavongs et al. 2008). The synthesized molecule 1 did not show significant effect on the growth of the tested bacteria w.r.t. their plant growth-promoting activities. More detail of plant growth activities by 1 can be seen in Supplementary Information S5.\n\nUV–Vis spectra and stability of 1-BSA complexes\nAn increase in the concentrations of 1 in the presence of BSA resulted increase in UV light absorption and shifting of BSA band at 279–274 nm that can be related to complex formation (Fig. 4). Molecule showed binding with BSA with a binding constants of 1.12 (±0.09) × 104 M−1. The binding constant for 1-BSA complex suggests a low affinity (<106) for complex formation, compared to strong ligand–protein complexes, with binding constants ranging from 106 to 108 M−1 (Bourassa et al. 2011; Kragh-Hansen 1990; Liu et al. 2004). In in vitro studies, organophosphate pesticides were not only found to bind with serine hydrolases but also to proteins that was not having serine as active site, e.g., Tyr 411 of human albumin and Lys 296 of mouse transferrin (Lockridge 2013). Higher the protein binding constant of agrochemicals or pesticides, higher will be the toxicity (Lockridge 2013; Kumar et al. 2013a). Interestingly, the low binding constant of 1 shows less toxicity of synthesized molecule toward protein interactions of organisms which is a major problem of maximum agrochemical especially in aquatic environment.Fig. 4 UV–Vis study of 1-BSA binding constant\n\n\n\nFTIR spectra of BSA and product-BSA complexes\nShifting of protein amide I band (mainly C=O stretch) and amide II band (C=N stretching coupled with N–H bending modes) which originally absorbs at 1653 and 1541 cm−1, respectively (Byler and Susi 1986; Krimm and Bandekar 1986) was observed as 1 interacted with BSA protein (Fig. 5). In recent studies, the observed FTIR peaks for the free protein are reported to be: α-helix (1656 cm−1), β-sheet (1618 and 1628 cm−1), turn structure (1670 cm−1), β-antiparallel (1693 and 1680 cm−1) and random coil (1638 cm−1) (Ahmed-Ouameur et al. 2006; Bourassa et al. 2010). The β-sheet structure is composed of two components at 1618 (inter β-strand) and 1628 cm−1 (intra β-strand) (hydrated) that are consistent with the spectroscopic current studies of bovine serum albumin (Ahmed-Ouameur et al. 2006; Bourassa et al. 2010; Byler and Susi 1986; Krimm and Bandekar 1986).Fig. 5 FTIR spectrum of free BSA and 1-BSA\n\n\n\nOn addition of 1 (0.00125 mM) to BSA, decrease in intensity as well as shift (4 cm−1) of the amide I band at 1658 cm−1 (BSA) was observed at 1654 cm−1. In the spectrum of 1-BSA complex, the reduction in intensity due to loss of protein structure of the amide I band was obtained and suggests major reduction in protein α-helical structure (Fig. 5) (Ahmed-Ouameur et al. 2006; Bourassa et al. 2010). The decrease in α-helix structure and increase in β-sheet and turn structures is indicative of protein destabilization upon interaction with 1.\n\nOn quantitative analysis of BSA and 1, free protein was found to have 69 % a-helix (1658 cm−1), 12 % β-sheet (1620 cm−1), 14 % turn structure (1676 cm−1), 3 % β-antiparallel (1690 cm−1) and 2 % random coil (1637 cm−1) structure (Fig. 5). The results are consistent with the spectroscopic studies of bovine serum albumin previously reported (Ahmed-Ouameur et al. 2006; Bourassa et al. 2010). Upon interaction of 1, a major decrease in α-helix from 69 % (free BSA) to 7.4 % (1-BSA at 0.00125 mM) was observed and 14 % in β-sheet (1-BSA, 0.00125 mM), 3.7 % in β-antiparallel (1-BSA, 0.00125 mM) and 4.7 % in random coil (1-BSA, 0.00125 mM) were obtained.\n\nComputational study\nHuckel charge densities and dipole–dipole interactions\nOften in organic chemistry, the “partial” charge on an atom of a compound highlights the nucleophilic or electrophilic site. In the current study, Huckel charge densities were analyzed theoretically as tabulated in Table 3. From this analysis, one thing is clear that P atom was obtained to have maximum positive charge (1.857) and was found to have better site for nucleophilic attack and double-bonded oxygen attached to P is itself may act like a nucleophile with a negative charge 1.184. Huckel charge densities are useful quantities to illustrate the charge distributions which can give the information about how the molecules interact with another molecule in environmental compartments.Table 3 Optimized Huckel charges and geometric parameter for 1\n\n\nHuckel charges\tBond length (Å)\tBond angle (°)\tBond angle (°)\t\n\nGeometric\nparameters\nof\nproduct\nincluding\nHuckel\ncharges\n\t\nC −0.176 [C(1)]\nC −0.024 [C(2)]\nC −0.159 [C(3)]\nC −0.032 [C(4)]\nC −0.144 [C(5)]\nC 0.135 [C(6)]\nN 0.139 [N(7)]\nN −0.275 [N(8)]\nP 1.857 [P(9)]\nO −1.184 [O(10)]\nS −0.132 [S(11)]\nO −0.484 [O(12)]\nC −0.164 [C(13)]\nC 0.064 [C(14)]\nH 0.032 [H(15)]\nH 0.028 [H(16)]\nH 0.029 [H(17)]\nH 0.029 [H(18)]\nH 0.028 [H(19)]\nH 0.092 [H(20)]\nH 0.102 [H(21)]\nH 0.048 [H(22)]\nH 0.042 [H(23)]\nH 0.047 [H(24)]\nH 0.036 [H(25)]\nH 0.034 [H(26)]\nH 0.033 [H(27)]\tC(1)–C(2) 1.387\nC(6)–C(1) 1.387\nC(1)–H(15) 1.067\nC(2)–C(3) 1.380\nC(2)–H(16) 1.074\nC(3)–C(4) 1.387\nC(3)–H(17) 1.070\nC(4)–C(5) 1.378\nC(4)–H(18) 1.072\nC(5)–C(6) 1.393\nC(5)–H(19) 1.070\nC(14)–H(27) 1.083\nC(14)–H(26) 1.079\nC(14)–H(25) 1.078\nC(13)–H(24) 1.078\nC(13)–H(23) 1.077\nC(13)–H(22) 1.077\nO(12)–C(14) 1.450\nS(11)–C(13) 1.890\nP(9)–O(12) 1.637\nP(9)–S(11) 2.225\nP(9)–O(10) 1.536\nN(8)–H(21) 1.010\nP(9)–N(8) 1.711\nN(7)–H(20) 1.007\nN(7)–N(8) 1.430\nC(6)–N(7) 1.418\tH(27)–C(14)–H(26) 109.490\nH(27)–C(14)–H(25) 110.562\nH(27)–C(14)–O(12) 109.979\nH(26)–C(14)–H(25) 110.378\nH(26)–C(14)–O(12) 110.125\nH(25)–C(14)–O(12) 106.264\nH(24)–C(13)–H(23) 112.011\nH(24)–C(13)–H(22) 110.472\nH(24)–C(13)–S(11) 108.533\nH(23)–C(13)–H(22) 110.981\nH(23)–C(13)–S(11) 108.500\nH(22)–C(13)–S(11) 106.117\nLp(30)–O(12)–Lp(29) 90.850\nLp(30)–O(12)–C(14) 109.500\nLp(30)–O(12)–P(9) 109.500\nLp(29)–O(12)–C(14) 109.500\nLp(29)–O(12)–P(9) 109.500\nC(14)–O(12)–P(9) 123.201\nC(13)–S(11)–P(9) 102.800\nO(12)–P(9)–S(11) 106.677\nO(12)–P(9)–O(10) 115.060\nO(12)–P(9)–N(8) 96.629\nS(11)–P(9)–O(10) 112.080\nS(11)–P(9)–N(8) 108.756\nO(10)–P(9)–N(8) 116.293\nLp(28)–N(8)–H(21) 90.360\nLp(28)–N(8)–P(9) 109.500\tLp(28)–N(8)–N(7) 109.500\nH(21)–N(8)–P(9) 114.031\nH(21)–N(8)–N(7) 114.741\nP(9)–N(8)–N(7) 115.639\nH(20)–N(7)–N(8) 111.651\nH(20)–N(7)–C(6) 115.282\nN(8)–N(7)–C(6) 115.324\nC(4)–C(5)–H(19) 119.430\nC(4)–C(5)–C(6) 120.640\nH(19)–C(5)–C(6) 119.929\nC(1)–C(6)–N(7) 122.839\nC(1)–C(6)–C(5) 118.510 \nN(7)–C(6)–C(5) 118.627\nC(3)–C(4)–H(18) 120.556\nC(3)–C(4)–C(5) 120.774\nH(18)–C(4)–C(5) 118.669\nC(2)–C(3)–H(17) 120.633\nC(2)–C(3)–C(4) 118.739\nH(17)–C(3)–C(4) 120.626\nC(1)–C(2)–H(16) 118.773\nC(1)–C(2)–C(3) 120.830\nH(16)–C(2)–C(3) 120.391\nC(2)–C(1)–H(15) 118.950\nC(2)–C(1)–C(6) 120.494\nH(15)–C(1)–C(6) 120.554\t\n\n\nThe optimized value of dipole–dipole interactions for the molecule 1 is 0.12, which is low, and it conforms that molecule 1 could interact or bind less with other living or organic molecules such as proteins, enzymes, DNA; consequently, molecule 1 may cause low harm to living organisms and total environment. Biggest impact of these interactions on living organisms was seen in past with protein folding (Campbell and Reece 2005; Le-Fèvre 1953). Every process of protein binding depends on net dipole–dipole interactions (Campbell and Reece 2005; Le-Fèvre 1953). From the analysis of these parameters of molecule 1, it is clear that this molecule may interact with the proteins, enzymes, DNA and essential organic molecules with low binding constant as was proved by low value of 1-BSA interactions.\n\nGeometric parameters and vibrational frequencies\nBond length and bond angles of 1 have been optimized (Table 3). These parameters may help the future studies like single-crystal analysis of 1. The optimized theoretical vibrational frequencies of product were found to be in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data (Table 4). The slight differences observed between the calculated and experimental values were observed mostly due to fact that the theoretical calculations were performed for the product in the gaseous phase, while the experimental results were obtained for the solid phase of the pesticides (Young 2001).Table 4 Optimized and experimental FTIR frequencies for 1\n\n\nOptimized frequencies (cm−1)a\n\tExperimental frequenciesa\n\tMode assignments\tShift values (cm−1)\t\n3650\t3640\t\nv(O–H)\t10\t\n3350\t3360\t\nv(N–H)\t10\t\n1790\t1890\t\nv(N=N)\t100\t\n1671\t1500\t\nv(C=C)\t121\t\n980\t1050\t\nv(C–N), v(C–O), v(P=O)\t70\t\n835\t830\t\nv(P–O)\t05\t\n707\t700\t\nv(N–H) oop, monosub.\t07\t\n\naOptimized frequencies are for gas phase, while experimental frequencies are in solid phase\n\n\n\nComputational evaluation of structural analogs of 1 for physical and molecular properties\nTwelve new analogs of 1 were prepared computationally (Fig. 6) and compared with 1. The HOMO–LUMO energy difference of analogs A1–A12 was calculated (Fig. 6; Table 5). It was obtained that all the molecules are non reactive due to their high energy difference. As per literature, the molecules with reduced HOMO–LUMO gaps <1.30 eV are chemically very reactive due to HOMO contribution to the decrease in the topological resonance energy (Aihara 1999). The observed value of energy difference for molecules A1–A12 lies between 33.311 and 1.542 eV. Hence, on the basis of HOMO–LUMO energy gap, the order of stability was: A11 ≫ A ≫ A9 = A6 > A10 > A8 > 1 = A2 = A3 > A1 > A4 > A12 > A5 ≫ > A7. But an interesting point was analyzed, i.e., once the phenyl molecule attached to 1, it converted into least stable molecule A7 with energy gap 1.542 eV. Disturbance of planarity and polarity may a reason behind it, because N–N site potentially making the 1 more planar. The P atom of 1 is exactly the site that can be polarized, especially because N–N group, O–X group and S–Y groups attached to P are unequal.Fig. 6 Chemical structures of new derivatives of 1 and values of average polarizability 〈α〉 in eV\n\nTable 5 Statistical parameters of electronic and physicochemical properties of analogs of 1\n\n\nCode\tAnalog\tStatistics\tPhysicochemical\tElectronic\t\n\nX\n\t\nY\n\tSeries\t\nR\n2\n\t\nE\nSteric (kcal/mol)\t〈α〉\tDipole (D)\t\nE\nLUMO (eV)\t\nE\nHOMO (eV)\t∆E (eV)\t\n\n1\n\tCH3\n\tCH3\n\t\t\t23.36\t94.68\t2.88\t0.490\t−6.319\t6.809\t\nA1\tC2H5\n\tC2H5\n\t1a\n\t0.98\t25.38\t100.65\t4.55\t0.490\t−6.316\t6.806\t\nA2\tC2H5\n\tCH3\n\t23.10\t91.12\t4.99\t0.490\t−6.319\t6.809\t\nA3\tCH3\n\tC2H5\n\t23.98\t88.00\t5.79\t0.490\t−6.319\t6.809\t\nA4\tC3H9\n\tC3H9\n\t2a\n\t0.95\t29.90\t125.84\t6.16\t0.490\t−6.310\t6.800\t\nA5\tCH3\n\tC3H9\n\t24.56\t97.84\t6.63\t0.490\t−6.307\t6.797\t\nA6\tC3H9\n\tCH3\n\t29.04\t93.48\t5.99\t0.490\t−6.353\t6.843\t\nA7\tC6H6\n\tC6H6\n\t3a\n\t0.93\t21.62\t125.09\t6.13\t0.490\t−1.052\t1.542\t\nA8\tCH3\n\tC6H6\n\t20.59\t118.15\t5.20\t0.490\t−6.321\t6.811\t\nA9\tC6H6\n\tCH3\n\t23.57\t79.89\t5.04\t0.490\t−6.353\t6.843\t\nA10\tC6H12\n\tC6H12\n\t4a\n\t0.96\t38.84\t164.31\t6.01\t0.490\t−6.351\t6.841\t\nA11\tC6H12\n\tCH3\n\t32.87\t153.46\t2.27\t26.97\t−6.341\t33.311\t\nA12\tCH3\n\tC6H12\n\t29.29\t126.42\t5.71\t0.490\t−6.309\t6.799\t\nA\t–\t–\t\t\t20.19\t55.57\t4.30\t2.313\t−10.01\t12.323\t\n\naSeries 1,2,3 and 4 include acephate (A)\n\n\n\nPolarizabilities and the prediction of the biodegradation\nThe computed averaged static dipole polarizability and dipole moment of molecules A1–A12 including 1 and acephate (A) were calculated. The component of the polarizability tensor was optimized along z-axis, i.e., along molecular axis. The values of average polarizabilities depend upon the positions of substituents bound to the moiety (Long 1982). The average polarizability (〈α〉) was calculated as per formula reported in the literature (Ostojic et al. 2014), i.e., 〈α〉 = (αxx + αyy + αzz)/3. The values of dipole moment and average polarizability for all molecules are tabulated in Table 5. As per recent computational studies, the biodegradation is directly proportional to the average polarizability of molecule (Long 1982; Ostojic et al. 2014). On the basis of average polarizability, the order of biodecomposition is: A9 > A3 > A2 > A6 > 1 > A5 > A1 > A8 > A7 > A4 > A4 > A12 > A11 > A10.\n\nA statistical relationship between polarizability of all the analogs was analyzed using origin 6.1 software. On the basis of substituents, analogs were divided into four series 1–4. Variations in polarizability of analogs were compared in all series w.r.t. acephate. Overall value of R2 was 0.54, indicating that all the analogs having significant (p < 0.05) difference in polarizability. The R2 value for series 1 (A, A1–A3) was 0.98, for series 2 (A, A4–A6) was 0.95, for series 3 (A, A7–A9) was 0.93 and for series 4 (A, A10–A12) was 0.96 (Fig. 7). Among the four series, order of biodecomposition was found in order 1 > 3 > 2 > 4.Fig. 7 Relationship with different derivatives of 1\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nPhenylhydrazine binds with acephate through nucleophilic attack on it. The obtained product neutralized toxic effect of acephate on plant growth-promoting strains. The binding of 1 to BSA protein and interactions with PGPR strains may not be expected to explain the toxicity directly, but it can serve as a model to study the effect of 1 and other pesticides on proteins and microorganisms. A combined experimental and computational study was developed with the aim of evaluating and understanding the structural, energetic and stability of 1.\n\nSafety\nAcephate is an organophosphate pesticide that inhibits the activity of cholinesterase. Direct contact with this should be avoided.

The aetiology of acne is multifactorial. Several pathophysiological associations have been identified in which Propionibacterium acnes plays a major role. This bacteria primarily affects areas containing oil glands including the face, back and trunk, where it causes the formation of seborrhoea and inflammatory lesions. The treatment methods currently in place have side effects. A novel alternative method with no side effects is hence required. In this study, we report the synthesis of an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacterial-based nanoparticle as a stable biocompatible material for drug delivery. We then evaluated the effectiveness of EPS-based nanoparticle cream against P. acnes. Our results demonstrate that EPS nanoparticles have great potential as a safe and effective topical treatment for acne vulgaris and other associated infections.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-015-0359-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nPropionibacterium acnesAcne vulgarisEPS nanoparticlesAntibacterial activityVignan's University fundingissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nAcne vulgaris (acne) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the sebaceous gland characterized by follicular hyperkeratinization and excessive colonization by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) (Beylot et al. 2014). Acne affects the majority of adolescents, who develop inflammatory lesions such as papules, pustules and nodules, as well as other non-inflammatory lesions (Webster 2014). P. acnes activates immune reactions by releasing chemo-active agents that attract neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kistowska et al. 2015). Despite the availability of a number of antibiotics, antibiotic resistant strains of acne are a cause of major global concern (Lomholt and Kilian 2014). In consequence, there have been increased attempts to find a naturally occurring anti-acne agent (Tin and Wiwanitkit 2014). Over the past few decades, exopolysaccharides have gained attention for their bioactive properties such as stability, biodegradability and biocompatibility. In general, exopolysaccharides (EPS) are usually anionic heteropolysaccharides due to the presence of various constituents such as xanthan, alginate and glycans, etc. EPS produced by microorganisms vary in their composition and properties such as anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, anti-tumoral, anti-ulcer, anti-immune stimulation along with cholesterol-lowering ability (Kumar et al. 2007; Raveendran et al. 2013; Raposo et al. 2014). The mechanism of EPS owing to the antimicrobial activity is attributed to its low degree of polymerization and degree of deacetylation (Poli et al. 2011). EPS penetrates into the cell membrane of the bacteria which in turn interrupts the replication process of bacteria there by suppressing microbial growth (Nwodo et al. 2012). In this study, we synthesized an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacterial-based nanoparticle serving as a stable biocompatible material for drug delivery. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the EPS-based nanoparticle cream’s antimicrobial activity against P. acnes.\n\nMaterials and methods\nIsolation studies of the P. acnes strain\nIsolation of P. acnes from the human skin was performed using nutrient broth (HiMedia, India) and Trypticase Soy Agar (HiMedia, India) with 5 % sheep blood on petri plates. Different facial samples of 1 cm2 were taken from 22 healthy human volunteers. These were cleansed with a sterile swab and placed in 5 mL of phosphate buffer saline (Life Technologies, USA). Dilutions were made, and 100 µl of each sample was plated then incubated anaerobically at 37 °C for 48 h. After 48 h of growth, biochemical tests were performed to determine the presence of P. acnes. The reference strain used in our study was P. acnes, microbial type culture collection (MTCC) no: 1951. Consent was obtained from patients who took part in this study and all ethical procedures were strictly followed.\n\nEPS extraction\nEPS was extracted from a biofilm-producing Acinetobacter Sea-9 bacterium (Kodali and Sen 2008; Sujana et al. 2013) by centrifuging the overnight bacterium culture at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to remove the bacterial cells. The obtained supernatant was collected in a fresh vial and precipitated with two volumes of ice-cold absolute ethanol by incubating the mixture at 4 °C overnight. The mixture was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C the following day. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing EPS was dried at room temperature. It was then dissolved in pure distilled water, and purified for 48 h by dialysis, using dialysis tubing with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off. Finally, the purified EPS was freeze-dried, and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy [FTIR (Mancuso Nichols et al. 2004)]. The total carbohydrate concentration was determined using phenol–sulphuric acid method (DuBois et al. 1956).\n\nSynthesis of EPS nanoparticles\nAs reported previously by others, chitosan molecules undergoing poly-electrolyte complexation with polysaccharides can spontaneously give rise to nanoparticles under strong magnetic stirring (Fotticchia et al. 2014). Various concentrations of EPS solutions were hence mixed with chitosan solution under strong magnetic stirring to form nanoparticles. EPS nanoparticles were prepared by complex formation between EPS and chitosan under strong magnetic stirring. Chitosan was dissolved in 1 % (w/v) acetic acid to obtain a final strength of 10 mg/mL. EPS concentrations were prepared in distilled water, as well as different solutions with 1–5 mg/mL concentrations at different pHs. Suspensions of nanoparticles formed spontaneously when chitosan solution was added to EPS solution under strong magnetic stirring at room temperature with varying pHs. Nanoparticle suspensions were filtered and mixed with cream formulation to check the antimicrobial properties (Sivakumar et al. 2014; Sathiyanarayanan et al. 2014).\n\nEPS nanocream formulation\nFor the oil phase, 1.85 g of beeswax was added to 5 mL of liquid paraffin, followed by a few drops of glycerine. For the aqueous phase, 0.15 g of borax was added to 3 mL DH2O. The cream was obtained by stirring the two phases continuously until they reached 70 °C. The emulsion of EPS nanoparticles and cream was prepared by adding 1 mL of the EPS solution at different concentrations (1–5 mg/mL). This was then left overnight to test for stability. The antimicrobial effect of the selected strain was tested using the agar well diffusion method (Bonev et al. 2008).\n\nResults\nIsolation studies of the P. acnes strain\nTwenty-two pure colonies were isolated, of which four samples numbered S4, S7, S14 and S19 were screened biochemically to identify the P. acnes strain. S19 showed similar biochemical characteristics to reference strain P. acnes MTCC 1951 (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1).Fig. 1 Gram staining of S19 bacteria. Staining confirmed that S19 is gram positive and rod shaped\n\n\n\nEPS analysis\nFTIR analysis of extract from Acinetobacter Sea-9 bacterium showed the presence of –OH band at 3346.62 cm−1 and COOH groups at 1637.86 cm−1 confirming that the sample was EPS. On chemical analysis using the phenol–sulphuric acid method, it was found that the total carbohydrate content in EPS extract was 78 μg/mL.\n\nSynthesis of EPS nanoparticles\nThe concentration and pH of chitosan and EPS solutions plays a crucial role in the formation of nanoparticles (Raveendran et al. 2013). Combinations of different pH were hence evaluated to determine the optimal level for the formation of stable nanoparticles. When the pH of chitosan solution was in the range of 3, and EPS solution was in the range of 4.5, stable nanoparticles were formed. Gradual increases or decreases in the pH values of EPS and chitosan solutions outside the above-stated optimal ranges resulted in precipitate formation. Combinations of various concentrations of chitosan and EPS solutions were also analysed for nanoparticle formation. When the concentration of chitosan was 6 mg/mL, and the EPS concentration varied between 1 and 7 mg/mL, an increase in the size of the particles was observed. Large aggregates were formed when the ratio was 6:6. Upon increasing the ratio to 6:7, macro-globules formed that were discernible to the naked eye.\n\nAntibacterial activity of the EPS nanoparticles\nThe antibacterial activity of EPS nanoparticles against S19 strain was performed by checking varying concentrations. The EPS nanoparticles were effective against P. acnes at a concentration of 39 μg/mL, and the zone of inhibition was measured as 18 mm (Fig. 2). Cream with and without chitosan did not show any activity against the organism. After 2 weeks, the EPS nanoparticles were found to be quite stable in a cream emulsion. It was observed that the zone diameter measured for the activity of EPS nanoparticles emulsified in cream was more or less same as that of solitary EPS nanoparticles (18 and 18.5 mm against S19, respectively). This proves that EPS nanoparticles are stable in emulsions. The antibiotic tetracycline was also effective against the organism, with a zone diameter of 24 mm (Fig. 2). However, literature suggests that the organism has shown resistance to such antibiotics (Simonart et al. 2008; Andriessen and Lynde 2014). A novel treatment should hence involve a substance which is less toxic but more effective.Fig. 2 Antibacterial activity of EPS nanoparticles in cream against sample 19 (S19) at 39 μg/mL concentration [Control (C)—tetracycline]; (no name—chitosan + cream)\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nAcne is a chronic inflammatory disease which is prevalent among adolescents and adults with significant psychological effects (Durai and Nair 2015). Acne-related psychological suffering could be consequently linked to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation (Pace 2014). Standard oral and topical therapies which are being administered are accompanied with side effects such as skin irritation, gastrointestinal upset, and the development of drug-resistant bacteria (Lauren 2014). Research suggests that many patients are vying towards safe alternative therapies for treatment of acne. Considering that exopolysaccharides are accompanied with no side effects (van Bueren et al. 2015), we synthesized and evaluated the effectiveness of EPS-based nanoparticle cream against P. acnes. These findings have opened new avenues to explore the significant role of EPS nanoparticles as a safe and effective topical treatment for acne vulgaris and other associated infections.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOCX 14 kb)\n\n \n\nThe authors thank Vignan’s University, India, for providing financial resources to execute this work.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors have no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAndriessen A  Lynde CW   Antibiotic resistance: shifting the paradigm in topical acne treatment J Drugs Dermatol 2014 13 1358 1364 25607703 \nBeylot C  Auffret N  Poli F  Claudel\n JP  Leccia MT  Giudice Del  Dreno B   Propionibacterium acnes : an update on its role in the pathogenesis of acne J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol 2014 28 271 278 10.1111/jdv.12224 23905540 \nBonev B  Hooper J  Parisot J   Principles of assessing bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics using the agar diffusion method J Antimic Chemother 2008 61 1295 1301 10.1093/jac/dkn090 \nDuBois M  Gilles KA  Hamilton JK  Rebers PA  Smith F   Colorimetric method for determination of sugars and related substances Anal Chem 1956 28 350 356 10.1021/ac60111a017 \nDurai PCT  Nair DG   Acne vulgaris  and quality of life among young adults in south India Indian J Dermatol 2015 60 33 40 10.4103/0019-5154.147784 25657394 \nFotticchia L  Fotticchia T  Mattia CA  Netti PA  Vecchione R  Giancola C   Thermodynamic signature of secondary nano-emulsion formation by isothermal titration calorimetry Langmuir 2014 30 14427 14433 10.1021/la503558w 25396753 \nKistowska M  Meier B  Proust T  Feldmeyer L  Cozzio A  Kuendig T  Contassot E  French LE   Propionibacterium acnes  promotes Th17 and Th17/Th1 responses in acne patients J Invest Dermatol 2015 135 110 118 10.1038/jid.2014.290 25010142 \nKodali VP  Sen R   Antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities of an exopolysacharide from probiotic bacterium Biotechnol J 2008 3 245 251 10.1002/biot.200700208 18246578 \nKumar AS  Mody K  Jha B   Bacterial exopolysaccharides—a perception J Basic Microbiol 2007 47 103 117 10.1002/jobm.200610203 17440912 \nLauren S   Skin pigmentation disorders: aetiology, assessment and aesthetic treatment options J Aesthetic Nurs 2014 5 224 229 \nLomholt HB  Kilian M   Clonality and anatomic distribution on the skin of antibiotic resistant and sensitive Propionibacterium acnes  Acta Derm Venereol 2014 94 534 538 10.2340/00015555-1794 24577497 \nMancuso Nichols CA  Garon S  Bowman JP  Raguénès G  Guézennec J   Production of exopolysaccharides by Antarctic marine bacterial isolates J Appl Microbiol 2004 96 1057 1066 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2004.02216.x 15078522 \nNwodo UU  Green E  Okoh AI   Bacterial exopolysaccharides: functionality and prospects Int J Mol Sci 2012 13 14002 14015 10.3390/ijms131114002 23203046 \nPace JL (2014) The polycystic ovary syndrome and acne.

Amongst various substrates, like, mustard oil cake, neem oil cake, groundnut oil cake, black gram peels, green gram peels, chickling vetch peels/grass pea peels wheat bran, pearl millet residues, finger millet waste, broken rice, banana peels (BP), apple pomace (AP) and orange peels, banana peel (Musa paradisiaca L.; Family: Musaceae) was most suitable for pectinase biosynthesis (LSSF: 400 ± 21.45 Uml−1; SSF: 6500 ± 1116.21 Ug−1). Optimization of process parameters using one-variable-at-a-time method revealed that an initial medium pH of 5.0 at 30 °C and 96 h of incubation along with mannitol, urea, ammonium persulfate and isoleucine have positive influence on pectinase production. Further, K+ (1 mM), Riboflavin (10 mg 100 ml−1) and gibberellic acid (0.025 %, w/v) supported in enhanced pectinase production. Banana peels and AP at a ratio of 9:1, moisture content of 90 % with 2 % inoculum size were suitable combinations for production of pectinase. Similarly, 96 h of soaking time with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) is essential for pectinase recovery. Purification to electrophoretic homogeneity revealed 1.42 fold purification with 8.08 % yield and a molecular weight of 24.6 kDa. Scaling up of various fermentation parameters and supplementing BP as the substrate for pectinase production with better recovery could make it promising for different industrial exploitation.\n\nKeywords\nAspergillus terreusLiquid static surface fermentationOVATSolid state fermentationUniversity Grants Commission, New Delhi, IndiaF.14-2 (SC)/2008 (SA-III), Dated. 31 MARCH, 2009Sethi Bijay Kumar issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nIn the industrial arena, pectinase, the catch-all idiom that refers to mixtures of primarily three different enzymatic activities [pectin Esterase (PE), polygalacturonase (PG) and pectin/pectate lyase (PL/PAL)] is produced by a variety of bacteria (Kashyap et al. 2001) and fungi (Huang and Mahoney 1999). Huge portions of the fungal glycoside hydrolases belongs to GH family 28 are associated with the biodegradation of pectin backbone (Martens-Uzunova and Schaap 2009). The enzymes that hydrolyze pectic substances are broadly known as pectinolytic enzymes or pectinases, which include polygalacturonase, pectin esterase, pectin lyase, and pectate lyase on the basis of their mode of action (Dinu et al. 2007). Pectinolytic enzymes are categorized on the basis of their cleavage of the galacturonan portion of the pectin molecule. They can be distinguished between pectinesterases (PE, E.C 3.1.1.11), which modify pectin esters into low methoxyl pectins or pectic acid and pectin deploymerases, that split the glycosidic linkages between galacturonosyl (methyl ester) residues. Polygalacturonases split glycosidic linkage next to free carboxyl groups by hydrolysis, while pectin and pectate lyases split α-1, 4-glycosidic linkages by transelimination ensuing in galacturonide with a double bond between C4 and C5 at the non-reducing end and smite the α-1, 4-allied d-galacturonic acid remainders within the smooth provinces of pectin through a β, α-elimination mechanism. Both these endo types of PGs and PLs (E.C 3.2.1.15 and E.C 4.2.2.2, respectively) are recognized as the arbitrary splitters of pectin chain. Exo-polygalacturonases (exo-PGs, E.C 3.2.1.67) liberate monomers or dimmers from the non-reducing side of the chain, whereas exopectate lyases (exo-PALs, E.C 4.2.2.9) discharge unsaturated dimers from the reducing end. Pectinases comprise a consortium of enzymes indispensable for the hydrolysis of pectin, which consist of endo-polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15), exo-polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.67), pectate lyase (EC 4.2.2.2), Exo-poly α-galactouronosidase (E.C.3.2.1.82), pectin lyase (EC 4.2.2.10), Exo-pectatelyase (E.C.4.2.2.9), Endopectin lyase (E.C.4.2.2.10) and pectin methyl esterase (EC 3.1.1.11). Depending on the pH optima, pectinases can also be categorized into acidic and alkaline types.\n\nAt contemporary, agricultural and food wastes are the major sources of pollution in developing countries which is being controlled by biological degradation using microorganisms for the biosynthesis of valuable compounds such as proteins, polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, vitamins, hormones, enzymes and others as raw materials for medical and industrial exploitations (El-Sheikh et al. 2009). Several microbes are capable of using these substances as carbon and energy sources for the biosynthesis of a vast array of pectinolytic enzymes in different environmental niches. But, the best-acknowledged microbial producers of pectinase are various species of Aspergillus and A.niger is the most admired one (Godfrey and West 1996). The impending fungal species exploited for the biosynthesis of pectinase are A. foetidus (Sebastian et al. 1996), A. niger (Taragano et al. 1997), A. awamori (Blandino et al. 2002), Rhizopus, Trichoderma, Penicillium and Fusarium spp. (Zeni et al. 2011).\n\nPectinases, explicitly polygalacturonases (PG) have gained significant worldwide applications in food and textile industries, in the biosynthesis of fruit juice (Singh et al. 2005), plant tissue maceration, wastewater treatment, degumming of plant webbers without any damage to the end products (Kapoor et al. 2001) and processing of vegetables and fruits and for clarification of juices and wines (Pereira et al. 2002). To reiterate, commercially significant pectinases (PG) have been employed in preparation of apple juice for higher juice yield, clarity, colloid concentration and polyphenolic contents (Oszmianski et al. 2009), coffee and tea fermentations, oil extraction (Hoondal et al. 2000), purification of viruses (Salazar and Jayasinghe 1999), and enhancement of chromaticity and stability of red wines (Revilla and Jose 2003). It has also been successfully supplemented in concurrence with amylase, lipases, cellulases, and hemicellulases to get rid of sizing agents from cotton in a secure and eco-friendly approach (Hoondal et al. 2000). Altogether, pectinases from microbial sources contribute almost 25 % of world wide food enzyme trading (Tari et al. 2007).\n\nSolid-state fermentation has been advocated superior than submerged culture for the processing of agricultural and agro-based industrial wastes for generating higher enzyme yield and regulating the biosynthesis of particular composition of enzyme mixtures (Patil and Dayanand 2006). The water activity (aw), pH, temperature, incubation time, moisture content, inoculums size, presence of inhibitors or activators, carbon and nitrogen sources are critical factors that also influence pectinase biosynthesis in solid-state fermentation (Taragano et al. 1997). Further, the selection and optimization of substrate and culture condition is another most imperative approach to trim down industrial costs of enzyme biosynthesis.\n\nKeeping in view, this present work aims at the bio-utilization of banana peels for biosynthesis of pectinase by Aspergillusterreus NCFT4269.10. In this study, various process parameters were evaluated, optimized and established for enhanced biosynthesis of biotechnologically significant pectinase by A. terreus NCFT 4269.10 based on the medium composition and cultural conditions in tune with the effective utilization of banana peels and biosynthesis of pectinase for future promises.\n\nMaterials and methods\nSubstrates and chemicals\nVarious agro-waste residues like mustard oil cake (MoC), neem oil cake (NoC), groundnut oil cake (GnoC), black gram peels (BGP), green gram peels (GGP), chickling vetch peels/grass pea peels (CVP) wheat bran (WB), pearl millet residues (PMR), finger millet waste (FMW), broken rice (BR), banana peels (BP), apple pomace (AP), and orange peels (OP) were purchased from the market of Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. Substrates were dried in the hot air oven at 60 °C up to 48 h, ground to fine powder, sieved and kept in sterile containers until used. All chemicals used in this study were of analytical reagent (AR) grade and purchased from Sigma, Hi-Media Limited, SRL Pvt. Limited and Merck India Limited (Mumbai, India).\n\nSource of fungal inoculum\nA pectinase producing seven-day-old potato dextrose agar (PDA) slant culture of Aspergillus terreus (NCFT 4269.10) (Sethi et al. 2013a) was suspended in 5.0 ml of sterile deionised water. Then, 1.0 ml of spore suspension was used as the inoculum for pre-fermentation culture and incubated at 30 ± 1 °C for a week to obtain about 5.0 × 108 spores ml−1. Finally, an initial spore density of 1 × 107 spores ml−1 was used as inoculum for fermentation (Sethi et al. 2013b).\n\nSelection of suitable substrate for fermentation\nLiquid static surface fermentation (LSSF) and solid state fermentation (SSF) were carried out using pre-processed substrates (10 g) as the constituents of fermentation medium. In Erlenmeyer flask of 150 ml capacity, sterilized fermentation medium (50 ml) having either MoC, NoC, GnoC, BGP, GGP, CVP, WB, PMR, FMW, BR, BP, AP, and OP as substrates was inoculated with 1 × 107 spores ml−1 from 7 days old pre-fermentation culture broth and incubated at 30 ± 1 °C under static condition (Sethi et al. 2013b). Similarly, Erlenmeyer flasks (250 ml) containing each sterilized 5 g (w/w) of substrate and 8 ml of minimal salt solution were inoculated aseptically with optimum number of spore inoculum and incubated at 30 ± 1 °C with intermittent observation. After 96 h, fermented media (both LSSF and SSF) were processed for recovery of crude pectinase. Further, LSSF and SSF were carried out by taking the selected substrate for extracellular pectinase biosynthesis. The crude pectinase thus obtained was preserved at −20 °C for subsequent experiments. Dry weight of the biomass was determined after drying at 80 °C in hot air oven (Wadegati Instruments Ltd., Mumbai) up to 24 h.\n\nOptimization of process parameters\nVarious environmental, nutritional and other fermentation parameters were established for enhanced production of pectinase using banana peel as the fermentation medium by SSF and LSSF. The process parameters optimized were pH (3–10), temperature (24–45 °C @ 3 °C interval), incubation time (24–168 h), additional carbon sources (1.0 %, w/w), nitrogen sources (organic and inorganic, 1.0 %, w/w), amino acids (1.0 mM), metal ions (1.0 mM), antioxidant vitamins (10–50 mg 100 ml−1), growth hormones (0.0025 mgg−1, w/w), combined agro-wastes, inoculum size (2–10 %) and initial moisture content (20–100 %). The effect of soaking time on fermented products (1–96 h), repeated extraction and various extractants were also standardized for the ease and economic down-streaming of pectinase. The approach adopted was to scale up one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT), independent of the others and consequently established conditions were adopted in rest of the experiments.\n\nPurification of pectinase\nThe crude culture filtrate (~500 ml) was precipitated by gradual addition of 40–80 % ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2S04] with constant stirring by a magnetic stirrer at 4 °C up to 24 h. Each precipitate was separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was decanted and the solid precipitate was dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at a ratio of 0.1 g ml−1 so as to obtain 10-times more concentrated enzyme solution (Jana et al. 2013). Thereafter, ammonium sulfate precipitated enzyme solution was dialyzed for 24 h at 4 °C with incessant stirring against a large volume (1 l capacity) of phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) for the complete removal of lower molecular weight metabolites and ammonium sulfate from the dialysate. To improve solute exchange, the dialysis buffer was replaced after every 2 h of incubation so as to ascertain a new concentration gradient. Then, the dialyzed enzyme was loaded into the Sephadex G-100 column (2.5 cm × 70 cm) and eluted with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) with the flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Fractions of 2 ml each were subsequently collected for estimation of protein (Lowry et al. 1951). The fractions showing maximum absorption at 750 nm were collected and evaluated for its enzyme activity. The enzyme positive fractions with higher enzyme activity were combined together, lyophilized and stored at −20 °C for further characterization.\n\nAnalytical methods\nTotal protein determination\nCrude and purified protein content was estimated as per Lowry et al. (1951) taking bovine serum albumin as the standard and was expressed as µg of protein present per ml of extract obtained after fermentation and purification.\n\nPectinase assay\n\nThe Standard protocol of Sigma Quality Control Department (Khairnar et al. 2009) was used for the enzyme assay. 0.5 % pectin solution (4.90 ml), 50 mM iodine with 200 mM potassium iodide (5.0 ml), 1 M sodium carbonate (1.0 ml), 2 M sulfuric acid (2.0 ml), 1 % pectin indicator (1–2 drops) and diluted pectinase solution (100 µl) were mixed thoroughly by swirling. The mixture (test and blank) was titrated with 100 mM sodium thiosulfate until it was turned to light yellow. To that, 1 drop of pectin indicator (starch) was added and continuously titrated until solution becomes colorless. One unit (U) of pectinase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 µg of product in 1 min under the assay conditions. The calculation for pectinase activity is presented below. Units/mlenzyme=1100mlofsodiumthiosulfateforblank-mlofsodiumthiosulfatefortestdf/50.12 where, 1 = one μmole galacturonic acid is oxidized by 1 microequivalent of I2, 100 = microequivalents of S2O3/ml of reagent E, df = dilution factor, 5 = time of reaction in minutes, 0.1 = volume (in mm) of enzyme used, 2 = microequivalents of S2O3 oxidized per microequivalent of I2 reduced.\n\nSDS-PAGE and Zymographic analysis\nThe samples (crude and purified pectinase) were electrophoresed in 10 % SDS-PAGE for molecular weight determination (Laemmli 1970). For visualization of bands, gels were stained in a staining solution [0.1 % (w/v) Coomassie-Brilliant Blue R-250, 50 % (v/v) methanol, 7 % (v/v) glacial acetic acid and 43 ml milli Q distilled water] for 90 min at room temperature followed by destaining with 30 % (v/v) methanol, 7 % (v/v) acetic acid and 63 ml milli Q distilled water until the background was clear. The relative positions of bands were analyzed using Bio-Rad Gel documentation system. Different molecular weight protein markers ranging from 7–175 kDa (Bangalore Genei Ltd.) were used for SDS-PAGE.\n\nFor native PAGE, enzyme sample was loaded with loading dye in a 10 % non-denaturing gel and run for 8 h in a discontinuous buffer system using 50 mM Tris-0.1 M glycine running buffer (pH 8.8) at 4 °C and 20 mA current. The gel was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in 1 % soluble pectin prepared by 50 mM citrate–phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) followed by staining with 1 % congo red solution for 15 min. Stained gel was washed repeatedly with 1 M NaCl until the bands become clear (Garcia-Garrido et al. 2000). The gel image was taken and analyzed by Bio-Rad Gel doc system.\n\nFermentation kinetics study\nFor fermentation using agro-wastes by A. terreus, the logistic Eq. (1) and Luedeking-Piret model (Eq. 2) were employed for microbial growth and enzyme biosynthesis, respectively. It is as follows. 1 dx/dt=μmax1-x/xmaxx  2 dP/dt=αμx-βx where dx/dt: biomass accumulation in the culture medium (g l−1 h−1); dP/dt: enzyme accumulation in the culture medium (U ml−1 h−1); x: biomass (mg ml−1) at time (t); µ: specific growth rate (h−1); µmax: highest specific growth rate observed during batch culture (mgl−1 h−1); xmax: maximum attainable biomass (mg ml−1); α: growth associated coefficient of enzyme production (U g−1); β: growth-independent coefficient of enzyme production (U g−1 h−1).\n\nReproducibility of results\nAll experiments were carried out in triplicates (n = 3) and repeated three times. The samples collected from each replicate were analyzed for biosynthesis of the enzyme including its activity and optimization (scale up) of culture conditions. Each value is an average of three parallel replicates. The ± and error bars indicate standard deviation among the replicates. For each individual experiment, one way ANOVA was calculated using SPSS 16.0 workbook software. Least significant differences were also calculated using Duncan’s new multiple range tests.\n\nResults and discussion\nSelection of suitable substrate\nThe increasing energy demands have focused worldwide attention on the utilization of renewable resources, particularly agricultural and forest residues, the major components of which are cellulose, starch, lignin, xylan, and pectin. These materials have attracted considerable attention as an alternative feedstock and energy source, since they are abundantly available in developing countries like India. Several microbes are capable of using these substances as carbon and energy sources by producing a vast array of enzymes in different environmental niches. Although, a large number of organisms biosynthesizing pectinases have been documented, but, assortment of industrially pertinent microbes remains a tiresome job especially, when physiologically impending strains are to be isolated to attain utmost yield (Pandey et al. 1999). The most difficult, labor intensive task in designing the production process entirely relies on the nature of microorganism, fermentation system and the substrate chosen. Keeping in view, a preliminary screening was performed using commercial citrus pectin for the selection of a suitable pectinolytic fungus (Sethi et al. 2013a). A native fungal isolate, Aspergillusterrues NCFT 4269.10 was found to be superior in pectinase production as compared to the previously reported results (Patil et al. 2012; Maller et al. 2013). Therefore, this fungal species was used for the subsequent experiments. Nevertheless, commercial pectin as medium component may be too costly to accommodate in any fermentation process. Therefore, for selection of suitable and economic substrate for pectinase biosynthesis using fermentation, various low cost substrates like MoC, NoC, GnoC, BGP, GGP, CVP, WB, BR, PM, FM, BP, AP, and OP were evaluated individually as principal media components. Among the various substrates, BP was found suitable for noticeable production of pectinase (550 ± 70.71 Uml−1; 6500 ± 1116.21 Ugds−1) (Table 1). Most of the substrates could not support the remarkable biosynthesis of pectinase except AP and OP (Table 1). This can be attributed to the higher pectin content (10–21 %) of banana peels as compared to the different agro-wastes taken for the study. Further, banana peel is also prosperous in proteins, essential amino acids, dietary fibre, polyunsaturated fatty acids, iron, and potassium (Juarez-Garcia et al. 2006). The peels are rich in large quantities of dopamine, an antioxidants (80–560 mg per 100 g in peel) containing 9.14 % of N (González-Montelongo et al. 2010) which is the cause of enhanced production of pectinase. SSF system has been explored than SmF for high volume-high-valued pectinase production using a variety of solid residues, many of which are of agro-industrial residues in origin. They include apple peels (Malus domestica), orange peels (Citrus sinensis), lemon peels (Citrus latifolia), passion fruit peels (Passiflora edulis), commercial mate herb (Illex paraguariensis), rice straw (Oryza sativa), sugar cane bagasse (Saccharum officinarum), corn cob (Zea mays), wheat bran (Triticum aestivum), and soya bran (Glycine max) (Maller et al. 2011). Likewise, wheat bran (Abbasi and Mortazavipur 2011) and cocoa beans (Akintobi et al. 2012) were also utilized for biosynthesis of pectinase. The substrate specificity was also reported for polygalacturonases from Mucor circinelloides ITCC 6025 (Thakur et al. 2010) and Aspergillus giganteus (Pedrolli and Carmona 2010). Ramadas et al. (1996) have reported three fold higher enzymatic activity in solid-state fermentation compared to static culture fermentation using A. niger that supports the present findings. In the same vein, this present study on agricultural residues has also shown that SSF is significantly better as a cultivation regimen as compared to SmF for production of fungal pectinase on banana peels.Table 1 Pectinase biosynthesis by Aspergillus terreus NCFT4269.10 in liquid static surface fermentation and solid state fermentation systems using various agricultural wastes as the substrates\n\nFermentation medium\tCultivation regimen\tPectinase activity\tTotal protein\tBiomass (g 50 ml−1)\t\nMoC\tLSSF\t100 ± 11.11\t478.33 ± 23.75\t0.203 ± 0.013\t\nSSF\t0\t21.75 ± 4.42\t–\t\nNoC\tLSSF\t0\t1723 ± 211.84\t0.094 ± 0.007\t\nSSF\t0\t3.13 ± 0.77\t–\t\nGnoC\tLSSF\t0\t1759.99 ± 25.76\t0.243 ± 0.002\t\nSSF\t0\t2593.33 ± 42.78\t–\t\nBGP\tLSSF\t0\t2446.64 ± 39.61\t0.085 ± 0.002\t\nSSF\t0\t1106.64 ± 11.27\t–\t\nGGP\tLSSF\t0\t4229.99 ± 56.24\t0.157 ± 0.004\t\nSSF\t0\t3889.98 ± 47.34\t–\t\nCVP\tLSSF\t0\t2266.98 ± 28.44\t0.2108 ± 0.006\t\nSSF\t0\t2066.33 ± 21.11\t–\t\nWB\tLSSF\t0\t458.98 ± 11.72\t0.080 ± 0.001\t\nSSF\t0\t229.99 ± 27.41\t–\t\nPM\tLSSF\t0\t246.19 ± 3.76\t0.1412 ± 0.212\t\nSSF\t0\t288.98 ± 5.66\t–\t\nFM\tLSSF\t500 ± 47.66\t446.64 ± 11.91\t0.032 ± 0.004\t\nSSF\t4000 ± 256.91\t106.64 ± 7.37\t–\t\nBR\tLSSF\t0\t759.99 ± 5.073\t0.1981 ± 0.0812\t\nSSF\t0\t593.33 ± 3.121\t–\t\nBP\tLSSF\t550 ± 70.71\t1234.99 ± 57.97\t0.017 ± 0.044\t\nSSF\t6500 ± 1116.21\t1478.33 ± 76.44\t–\t\nAP\tLSSF\t400 ± 21.45\t4488.98 ± 112.56\t0.2117 ± 0.0217\t\nSSF\t4000 ± 276.82\t4467.33 ± 125.42\t–\t\nOP\tLSSF\t250 ± 21.77\t1759.99 ± 89.65\t0.031 ± 0.065\t\nSSF\t4000 ± 276.93\t2459.98 ± 124.76\t–\t\nControla\n\tLSSF\t100 ± 11.79\t1234.99 ± 48.22\t0.0804 ± 0.001\t\nThe liquid static surface fermentation (LSSF) and solid state fermentation (SSF) experiments were performed for 96 h at 30 °C.

(2012). But Patil et al. (2012) reported that pH 6.0 was optimum for production of pectinase by Paecilomycesvariotii NFCCI 1769. As this enzyme was synthesized maximum at pH 5.0, hence can be an acidic pectinase (Kashyap et al. 2001) and it is polygalacturonase/pectin depolymerase/pectinase (E.C. 3.2.1.15). A decrease in final pH of the medium was observed in most of the cases. The pH of the medium also regulates the growth of the culture or exerts impact upon catalytic activity of the enzyme. According to Zeni et al. (2011), the acidification or alkalization of culture medium reflects the substrate consumption. Due to this, relation between the synthesis of polygalacturonases and the consumption of nitrogen compounds, the change of pH can be used to conclude with important information about the enzyme production with commencement and retardation of its synthesis.Fig. 1 Effect of pH (3.0–10.0), incubation time (24–144 h) and temperature (24–45 °C @ 3 °C interval) on pectinase production and mycelia growth in liquid static surface culture (LSSF) by Aspergillus terreus NCFT 4269.10 (for pH, biomass of A. terreus: filled square; pectinase: filled diamond; for temperature, biomass of A. terreus: open square; pectinase: open diamond)\n\n\n\nEffect of temperature\nKeeping the pH of the fermentation medium constant (pH 5.0), the LSSF was carried out at varying range of temperature (24–45 °C; an interval of 3 °C) for 96 h. Biosynthesis of pectinase and mycelial growth were utmost at 30 °C (Fig. 1). The enzyme, pectinase biosynthesis by A. terreus is in accordance with the report of Maciel et al. (2011). Similarly, for pectinase biosynthesis, Patil et al. (2012), Adeleke et al. (2012) and Maller et al. (2013) reported that 40 °C temperature was suitable which disagrees with the present findings. Mrudula and Anitharaj (2011) have also documented an optimum biosynthesis of pectinase using orange peels by Aspergillus niger at 50 °C. Nevertheless, the assessment of enzyme activities biosynthesized by numerous microorganisms is complicated, while discrete culture parameters and enzyme activity determinations have been employed (Maciel et al. 2011).\n\nEffect of incubation time on biosynthesis of pectinase\nAt constant pH and temperature, the liquid static surface fermentation was performed at varying incubation period and concluded that maximum production was attained at 96 h of incubation though the biosynthesis started at 24 h. Meanwhile, the generation of biomass initiated within 24 h and gradually increased up to 144 h without showing any decline in growth profile. Further, the biosynthesis of enzyme was not strongly correlated with biomass production (Fig. 1). Maller et al. (2011) have also reported that production of maximum pectinase by A. niveus was recorded at 96 h of incubation which is in accordance with the current findings. Similarly, Mrudula and Anitharaj (2011) reported an optimum production of pectinase using orange peels as the agro-wastes by Aspergillus niger at 50 °C, pH 5 and 96 h of incubation. Patil et al. (2012) reported that maximum exo-polygalacturonase activity was obtained on the third day of incubation at 40 °C which differs from the present findings. Adeleke et al. (2012) concluded that Penicillium atrovenetum, Aspergillus flavus and A. oryzae produced polygalacturonase optimally on the 5th day while endoglucanase was produced optimally on the 7th day. The present finding was somehow different from the above reports and this might be due to the nature of substrate that induces the production of the enzyme at early late phase.\n\nEffect of carbon sources on production of pectinase\nPectinase was produced at constant pH and temperature for 96 h with supplementation of additional carbon sources. It was concluded that pectinase production was enhanced when mannitol was served as the additional source of carbon. Rest of the carbon sources was not appropriate for biosynthesis of pectinase. Almost half of the activity was reduced as compared to the control when starch was supplemented with the banana peels as the nutrient supplement (Fig. 2). Starch as a substrate could not be able to support the secretion of pectinase is also reported by Arotupin (2007). Mrudula and Anitharaj (2011) reported an optimum production of pectinase on orange peels by Aspergillus niger when supplemented with sucrose. Similarly, Abbasi and Mortazavipur (2011) reported glucose and pectin supplementation along with wheat flour enhanced the Exo-PGase activity. This ability of A. terreus indicates that polygalacturonase production is not only inducible but constitutive.Fig. 2 Effect of various carbon and nitrogen sources on the mycelia growth and pectinase production by Aspergillus terreus, where, Glu glucose, Mal maltose, Lac lactose, Man mannitol, Suc sucrose, Str starch, Cell cellulose, AP ammonium persulfate, AN ammonium nitrate, AS ammonium sulfate, AC ammonium chloride, SN sodium nitrate, UR urea, Pep peptone, Trp tryptone, Gly glycine, Gel gelatin, YE yeast extract and BE beef extract\n\n\n\nEffect of nitrogen sources on production of pectinase\nOut of the five organic nitrogen sources, peptone was found to be the best organic nitrogen source followed by yeast extract for exuberant biosynthesis of pectinase. Among all inorganic nitrogen sources evaluated, ammonium persulfate was most suitable for production of pectinase followed by sodium nitrate and urea. About three-fold increase in pectinase activity was attained with ammonium persulfate. All inorganic nitrogen sources have positive influence on pectinase biosynthesis indicating that the enzyme synthesis can be enhanced by supplementing cost-effective inorganic nitrogen sources (Fig. 2). In a study by Adeleke et al. (2012), highest production of polygalacturonase and endoglucanase by Penicillium atrovenetum was observed at pH 5, 40 °C and at 0.2 % ammonium persulfate which supports the present finding with maximum synthesis of pectinase (Fig. 2). Similar finding was also obtained by Akhter et al. (2011). Among the organic nitrogen substrates utilized peptone supported pectinase yield and can be comparable with the results reported by Akhter et al. (2011). This is in consonance with Arotupin (2007) who reported that organic nitrogen sources maintain the growth of fungi more than inorganic nitrogen sources. During growth, the fungi probably hydrolyze the organic nitrogen releasing their mineral component and other growth factors present in them into constituents that can be easily incorporated into the cellular metabolism.\n\nEffect of amino acids on production of pectinase\nIn the present study, seventeen amino acids were supplemented to the fermentation medium and found that isoleucine at a concentration of 1 mM enhanced three-fold biosynthesis of pectinase, whereas, maximum biomass was attained with proline (Table 2). Demir et al. (2011) suggested that l-cysteine and ascorbic acid significantly enhanced pectinase activity in Geobacillusstearothermophilus which differs from the present findings.Table 2 Effect of amino acids, metal ions, vitamins and growth regulators on the mycelia growth and pectinase production by Aspergillus terreus NCFT 4269.10a\n\n\nDifferent sources\tPectinase\t\nBiomass (g/50 ml)\tActivity (Uml−1)\tpHb\n\t\n\nAmino acids (5 mM/100 ml)\n\t\nAlanine\t0.45 ± 0.001bc\n\t1150 ± 71ef\n\t4.3\t\nProline\t0.78 ± 0.007a\n\t450 ± 71jk\n\t5.6\t\nValine\t0.52 ± 0.006b\n\t800 ± 141h\n\t4.6\t\nAspartic acid\t0.41 ± 0.005c\n\t700 ± 141i\n\t4.2\t\nMethionine\t0.67 ± 0.228ab\n\t750 ± 71ih\n\t4.8\t\nGlutamate\t0.35 ± 0.007c\n\t350 ± 71k\n\t3.9\t\n\nl-lycine\t0.39 ± 0.008c\n\t950 ± 71g\n\t4.4\t\nCysteine\t0.39 ± 0.007c\n\t850 ± 71gh\n\t4.4\t\nHistidine\t0.42 ± 0.004c\n\t650 ± 71j\n\t4.2\t\nPhenyl alanine\t0.32 ± 0.007c\n\t850 ± 71gh\n\t4.7\t\nIsoleucine\t0.49 ± 0.031bc\n\t1700 ± 141b\n\t7.7\t\nThreonine\t0.32 ± 0.001c\n\t1400 ± 141d\n\t4.2\t\nTryptophan\t0.46 ± 0.009bc\n\t200 ± 0.00 l\n\t4.1\t\nAgrinine\t0.28 ± 0.007d\n\t850 ± 71gh\n\t4.9\t\nLeucine\t0.37 ± 0.000bc\n\t250 ± 71kl\n\t4.3\t\nGlycine\t0.35 ± 0.000c\n\t1150 ± 71ef\n\t4.7\t\nSerine\tND\tND\tND\t\n\nMetal ions (1 mM)\n\t\nZn2+\n\t0.05 ± 0.001h\n\t350 ± 71kl\n\t4.9\t\nK+\n\t0.12 ± 0.051e\n\t1650 ± 71bc\n\t4.9\t\nAg2+\n\t0.08 ± 0.002f\n\t50 ± 71m\n\t4.4\t\nFe2+\n\t0.11 ± 0.012e\n\t250 ± 71l\n\t4.8\t\nMg+\n\t0.15 ± 0.011e\n\t200 ± 71l\n\t4.7\t\nCu2+\n\t0.13 ± 0.014e\n\t450 ± 71k\n\t4.2\t\nMn+\n\t0.13 ± 0.011e\n\t1250 ± 141e\n\t4.4\t\nCa+\n\t0.11 ± 0.000e\n\t200 ± 71l\n\t5.1\t\nHg+\n\t0.05 ± 0.001g\n\t750 ± 141ih\n\t5.0\t\nEDTA\t0.12 ± 0.016e\n\t400 ± 71k\n\t4.7\t\n\nVitamins (mg/100 ml)\n\t\nVitamin C\t\n 10\t1.89 ± 0.00b\n\t3650 ± 212a\n\t6.9\t\n 20\t1.95 ± 0.03a\n\t3150 ± 71e\n\t6.4\t\n 30\t2.03 ± 0.07a\n\t3250 ± 71d\n\t6.1\t\n 40\t1.89 ± 0.12b\n\t3350 ± 212cd\n\t6.4\t\n 50\t1.99 ± 0.02a\n\t3350 ± 212cd\n\t6.5\t\nRiboflavin\t\n 10\t1.98 ± 0.01a\n\t3700 ± 141a\n\t6.2\t\n 20\t1.81 ± 0.08cd\n\t3350 ± 212c\n\t6.6\t\n 30\t1.59 ± 0.13e\n\t3250 ± 71d\n\t6.6\t\n 40\t1.52 ± 0.08e\n\t3150 ± 71e\n\t6.7\t\n 50\t2.11 ± 0.02a\n\t3450 ± 71b\n\t6.2\t\nFolic acid\t\n 10\t1.64 ± 0.05de\n\t3400 ± 141bc\n\t5.2\t\n 20\t1.45 ± 0.03ef\n\t3250 ± 71ce\n\t5.1\t\n 30\t1.54 ± 0.06e\n\t3250 ± 71cd\n\t5.4\t\n 40\t1.48 ± 0.02e\n\t3350 ± 212c\n\t5.3\t\n 50\t1.12 ± 0.02g\n\t3250 ± 71cd\n\t5.5\t\nVitamin E\t\n 10\t1.78 ± 0.12d\n\t3400 ± 141c\n\t6.3\t\n 20\t1.89 ± 0.01b\n\t3450 ± 71bc\n\t6.2\t\n 30\t1.37 ± 0.01f\n\t3250 ± 71d\n\t5.7\t\n 40\t1.42 ± 0.01ef\n\t3350 ± 71bc\n\t6.3\t\n 50\t1.04 ± 0.00g\n\t3300 ± 141c\n\t6.4\t\n\nGrowth regulators (0.0025 mg/g, w/w)\n\t\nGibberellic acid\t1.08 ± 0.16a\n\t1400 ± 100a\n\t5.2\t\nKinetin\t1.03 ± 0.13a\n\t950 ± 50bc\n\t4.7\t\n6-Benzylaminopurine\t0.93 ± 0.21b\n\t700 ± 100c\n\t4.9\t\n2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid\t0.47 ± 0.08c\n\t200 ± 58d\n\t5.3\t\nThe data represent mean ± SD of replicates (n = 3). Mean values within a column with different upper-script letters are significantly different at p ≤ 0.05\n\n\naThe liquid static surface fermentation experiments were performed for 4 days at 30 °C for all the cases\n\n\nbpH: initial pH was adjusted 7.0 required for the biosynthesis of pectinase\n\n\n\nEffect of metal ions\nIn the present study, it was observed that K+ has positive influence on biosynthesis of pectinase in comparison to other metal ions. Nonetheless, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Ca2+ have supported in biomass production. Addition of K+ to the fermentation medium at pH 5.0, temperature 30 °C and incubation of 96 h exhibited about three-fold higher pectinase biosynthesis (Table 2). This is also authenticated that pectinase may be a metalloenzyme, which is activated in the presence of metals, especially, the K+. JagadeeshBabu and Viswanathan (2010) have reported that significant enhancement in the level of pectinase production by A.foetidus NCIM 505 was achieved with Cu2+ which was found to be deleterious for A. terreus.\n\nEffect of vitamins on biosynthesis of pectinase\nThe influence of various vitamins on the production of biomass and pectinase using A. terreus was evaluated by supplementing with banana peel medium at LSSF and found that riboflavin at 10 mg/100 ml concentration exhibited ~sevenfolds pectinase activity (3700 ± 53.03 Uml−1) (Table 2). Maximum biomass was obtained with riboflavin when supplemented at 50 mg/100 ml concentration to the fermentation medium. Afifi et al. (2008) also reported that vitamin C had the most pronounced effect on growth, protein accumulation and pectinase production by P. olsonii which deviates from the present findings. Similarly, vitamin C and riboflavin stimulated the synthesis of pectinase. From the results obtained with A. terreus, it is suggested that supplementation of vitamins is not an absolute demand for the production of pectinase and growth. Similar observations were also reported with Volvariella esculanta (Jonathan et al. 2004) and V. speciosa (Fasidi and Akwakwa 1996), the edible mushrooms of Nigeria.\n\nEffect of plant growth hormones on biosynthesis of pectinase\nTo determine the effect of growth hormones (BAP, 2–4 D, Kinetin and gibberellic acid) on production of the enzyme, fermentation medium was supplemented with various growth hormones at the concentration of 0.025 % (w/v) after sterilization. Except 2–4, D, all the rest three supported in secretion of pectinase as well as production of protein and biomass (Table 2). Negi and Banerjee (2010) also studied the effect of growth hormones on production of pectinase and protease and observed that indol acetic acid (IAA) and Indol-3-butyric acid (IBA) stimulated production of both the enzymes produced by A. awamori. The report of Negi and Banerjee (2010) indicates that napthelene acitic acid (NAA) and 2–4, D enhanced production of protease but on the other hand, biosynthesis of pectinase was reduced.\n\nEffect of mixed substrates on enzyme production\nVarious agro-wastes were mixed at different proportions and evaluated for their suitability to enhance the production of pectinase using SSF. It was concluded that BP: AP @ 9:1; BP: OP @ 3:7 exhibited highest pectinase production (Table 3). Similarly, Adeleke et al. (2012) evaluated the potential of the fungi to biosynthesize pectinase and cellulase employing orange peels as substrates. Mixture of orange bagasse and wheat bran was the best substrate for the production of pectinase in solid state fermentation using a Penicillium sp.Table 3 Effect of mixed agro-wastes on pectinase biosynthesis\n\nMixed substrates\tRatio\tPectinase activity (Ugds−1)\t\nBanana peels : orange peels\t1:9\t8500 ± 707.1bc\n\t\n3:7\t10,000 ± 0.00a\n\t\n5:5\t8500 ± 707.1c\n\t\n7:3\t7500 ± 707.1d\n\t\n9:1\t9000 ± 0.00bc\n\t\nBanana peels: apple pomace\t1:9\t4500 ± 707.1g\n\t\n3:7\t4000 ± 0.00g\n\t\n5:5\t8500 ± 707.1c\n\t\n7:3\t9500 ± 707.1b\n\t\n9:1\t10,500 ± 707.1a\n\t\nOrange peels : apple pomace\t1:9\t7000 ± 1414.2de\n\t\n3:7\t6500 ± 707.1e\n\t\n5:5\t7000 ± 1414.2de\n\t\n7:3\t9500 ± 707.1bc\n\t\n9:1\t7000 ± 1414.2d\n\t\nControla\n\t–\t5500 ± 707.1f\n\t\n\naControl refers to only BP taken as solid state fermentation medium (10 % w/v). The solid state fermentation setups were performed as per the above combination for a period of 96 h at 30 °C. The data represent mean ± SD of replicates (n = 3). Mean values within a column with different upper-script letters are significantly different at p ≤ 0.05\n\n\n\nEffect of inoculum size\nTo determine the effect of inoculum size on production of enzyme, 2–10 % (v/w) inoculum was used in SSF medium by spore counting with haemocytometer and spectrophotometric analysis and evaluated for the production of enzyme. With 2 % inoculum, the biosynthesis of pectinase was maximum. However, further increase in size of inoculum resulted in decreased enzyme synthesis, probably due to depletion of the nutrients in the fermented medium. Mrudula and Anitharaj (2011) reported an optimum production of pectinase on orange peels by Aspergillus niger using 2.5 ml inoculums size. Maciel et al. (2011) have also reported that 1 × 107 sporesg−1 was best for maximum synthesis of pectinase which was also similar with the report obtained from A. terreus.\n\nEffect of initial moisture content\nAt 90 % moisture content optimum pectinase was produced (Fig. 3). But, Maller et al. (2011) reported 67 % humidity is suitable for biosynthesis of pectinase which is different in case of A. terreus (Fig. 3). Mrudula and Anitharaj (2011) reported an optimum production of pectinase using orange peels by Aspergillus niger with 1:2 % (v/w) moisture.Fig. 3 Effect of inoculum size and initial moisture content on biosynthesis of extracellular pectinase by Aspergillus terreus NCFT 4269.10 performed for 96 h at 30 °C using solid state fermentation\n\n\n\nDown streaming of pectinase\nAfter the successful SSF, extraction of pectinase was an obligatory step in achieving maximum recovery of this enzyme. Hence, the fermented matter was soaked with phosphate buffer (0.1 M) at varying interval of time to standardize an efficient soaking time for maximum release of enzyme. To extract the pectinase, fermented matter was soaked with phosphate buffer and 48 h of soaking was most suitable for maximum recovery of the enzyme. Repeated extraction with buffer facilitated the release of pectinase. However, at second time extraction with phosphate buffer, the release of enzyme was better than the first extraction. Among nine extractants, phosphate buffer (pH 6.5; 0.1 M) was most suitable in the release of enzyme. Other extractants were less supportive for efficient release of pectinase (Table 4).Table 4 Effect of soaking time, repeated extraction and various extractants on pectinase recovery\n\nExtraction\tPectinase activity\t\nUgds−1\n\tUmg−1\n\tUg−1\n\t\n\nSoaking time (h)\n\t\n0.5\t2500 ± 710f\n\t963 ± 270h\n\t500 ± 140g\n\t\n1\t3500 ± 710e\n\t1251 ± 190g\n\t700 ± 140f\n\t\n3\t4500 ± 710d\n\t1954 ± 300f\n\t900 ± 140e\n\t\n5\t5500 ± 710c\n\t2574 ± 220e\n\t1100 ± 140d\n\t\n7\t7500 ± 710b\n\t3736 ± 220c\n\t1500 ± 140b\n\t\n17\t6500 ± 710bc\n\t3592 ± 690c\n\t1300 ± 140c\n\t\n24\t5500 ± 710c\n\t2541 ± 260e\n\t1100 ± 140cd\n\t\n48\t12,500 ± 710a\n\t5297 ± 420a\n\t2500 ± 140a\n\t\n72\t12,000 ± 0a\n\t4727 ± 130b\n\t2400 ± 140a\n\t\n96\t11,500 ± 710a\n\t4652 ± 230ab\n\t2500 ± 140a\n\t\n\nRepeated extraction\n\t\n1\t6500 ± 710bc\n\t870.8 ± 270i\n\t700 ± 140f\n\t\n2\t7500 ± 710b\n\t3280 ± 410d\n\t1500 ± 140b\n\t\n3\t5500 ± 710c\n\t3726 ± 210c\n\t1100 ± 140d\n\t\n\nDifferent extractants\n\t\nPB (0.1 M)\t5500 ± 710c\n\t1992 ± 310f\n\t1100 ± 140d\n\t\nPB +Trit × 100 (0.1 %, w/v)\t4500 ± 710d\n\t2066 ± 280ef\n\t900 ± 140e\n\t\nPB +Trit × 100 (0.5 %, w/v)\t3500 ± 710e\n\t1187 ± 210gh\n\t700 ± 140f\n\t\nPB +Trit × 100 (1 %, w/v)\t3000 ± 710ef\n\t865.4 ± 310i\n\t600 ± 140fg\n\t\nPB + Urea (1 M)\t2500 ± 710f\n\t599.4 ± 340j\n\t500 ± 140g\n\t\nPB + Amm.

Maller et al. (2013) purified pectinase from Aspergillusniveus using DEAE-cellulose followed by Biogel P-100 column and resulted in PG purification approximately 4.4-fold with 17.4 % recovery. While working with Paecilomycesvariotii NFCCI 1769, Patil et al. (2012) reported that overall purification of pectinase was about 41.91 fold with a recovery of 26.90 %.Table 5 Purification summary of isolated pectinase\n\nSteps\tVolume\tActivity (Uml−1)\tTotal pectinase activity (U)\tTotal protein (mg)\tSpecific activity (Umg−1)\tPurification fold\tYield (%)\t\nCrude\t422\t550\t232,100\t521.165\t445.35\t1.0\t100\t\nAmmonium sulfate precipitation\t24\t950\t22,800\t44.64\t510.75\t1.15\t9.82\t\nSephadex G-100\t15\t1250\t18,750\t29.54\t634.73\t1.42\t8.08\t\n\n\nMolecular weight determination by SDS-PAGE and Zymographic analysis\nThe bands produced by the crude extracts of pectinase ranged from 7 to 175 kDa. But, the molecular weight of purified pectinase was found to be ~25 kDa (Fig. 4). Enzymatic activity was confirmed in native PAGE (zymographic analysis) that showed a unique degradation of sodium polypectate band. Reports also describe PG with high molecular mass as 60–70 kDa from Aspergillusgiganteus (Pedrolli and Carmona 2010).Fig. 4 Electrophoretic analysis of pectinase a (M marker, CP crude pectinase), b (M marker, PEC purified pectinase), c (ZA zymographic analysis of pectinase)\n\n\n\nFermentation kinetics study\nData obtained from above experiment was subjected to kinetics analysis for the calculations of μmax (h−1) (specific growth rate), qp (unit product produced/g spores s/h), qs (g substrate consumed/g spores s/h), Yp/s (unit product produced/g substrate consumed), Yp/x (unit product produced/g spores s formed), Yx/s (g spores s/g substrate utilized), Qp (g spores s produced/l/h) and Qs (g substrate consumed/l/h). The kinetic evaluation results also revealed that the optimum fermentation period for extracellular biosynthesis of pectinase by A. terreus was 96 h with a constant growth rate. Nonetheless, growth and enzyme secretion were significantly affected by engineering of the fermentation media (supplementation of nutrients) and optimization of different parameter. The specific production rate and growth coefficient revealed hyperproducibility of extracellular pectinase (Table 6). Similar type of observation was also reported by Iftikhar et al. (2010) for production of lipase from Rhizopus oligosporus var. microsporus.Table 6 Fermentation kinetics of biosynthesized pectinase\n\nOptimum conditions\tYe/s (Ug−1)\tYx/s (gg−1)\t\nα (Ug−1)\t\nβ (Ug−1 h−1)\tqc (mgg−1 h−1)\tdx/dt (gL−1h−1)\tdP/dt (Uml−1 h−1)\t\nx (mg ml−1)\t\nµ\nmax (mgl−1 h−1)\t\npH (5.0)\t120\t0.015\t7594.93\t1.25\t3.29\t0.016\t6.25\t1.58\t16.46\t\nTemperature (30 °C)\t110\t0.031\t3481.01\t1.145\t6.583\t0.033\t5.73\t3.16\t32.92\t\nIncubation period (96 h)\t230\t0.037\t6084.65\t2.395\t7.875\t0.040\t11.98\t3.78\t39.37\t\nCarbon source (Mannitol)\t130\t–\t–\t1.354\t–\t–\t6.77\t–\t–\t\nOrganic nitrogen (Urea)\t140\t–\t–\t1.458\t–\t–\t7.29\t–\t–\t\nInorganic nitrogen (NH4S2O8)\t370\t–\t–\t3.854\t–\t–\t19.27\t–\t–\t\nAmino acid (Isoleucine)\t340\t0.098\t3469.38\t3.541\t20.41\t0.102\t17.71\t9.80\t102.08\t\nMetal ion (K+)\t330\t0.197\t1671.73\t3.437\t41.12\t0.017\t17.19\t19.74\t205.62\t\nVitamins (Riboflavin, 10 mg)\t740\t0.396\t1868.68\t7.708\t82.5\t0.412\t38.54\t39.60\t412.50\t\nInoculums size (2 %), SSF\t5500\t–\t–\t57.29\t–\t–\t–\t–\t–\t\nMoisture content (90 %), SSF\t13,000\t–\t–\t135.42\t–\t–\t–\t–\t–\t\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study revealed the possibilities of effective utilization of agro-wastes in fermentation (LSSF and SSF) processes as potential substrates where they can act as carbon, nitrogen sources and ultimately produced industrially pertinent enzymes. Obviously, such amalgamation of processes would not only facilitate to trim down the entire production cost, but also focus on the approaches towards effective management of agro-wastes.

In these villages the aerobic heterotrophic, Gram-negative, spore-forming, starch-hydrolyzing, Pseudomonas, nitrate-reducing, denitrifying, asymbiotic N2 fixing, nitrifying, phosphate-solubilizing bacterial populations ranged from 1.22 to 2.67 × 106, 0.09–1.63 × 105, 1.53–3.68 × 105, 2.22–4.06 × 105, 0.02–0.04 × 105, 0.35–1.33 × 105, 0.07–0.82 × 105, 0.58–2.50 × 105, 0.13–2.35 × 105, 0.05–1.9 × 105 cfu/g dry soil, respectively. The organic carbon content of the soil samples ranged from 0.61 to 0.93 %. The available nitrogen and phosphate in the soils of the study area varied from 11.2 to 29.5 and 230.8–503.09 mg/kg, respectively. The one-way ANOVA revealed significant variations (p < 0.05) in the microbial diversity with respect to different locations of the study site. Shannon-Wiener and Simpson Index of the study areas ranged from 1.56 to 1.88 and 3.85–5.73, respectively. Jatimati showed comparatively higher diversity index among the villages of the study area. From principal component analysis, three components were extracted having the Eigen values of 3.541, 1.603 and 1.391, respectively. Agglometric hierarchial cluster analysis in respect of the number of different bacterial groups in different places of the study area showed that the denitrifying, nitrate reducing, asymbiotic nitrogen-fixing and spore-forming bacteria formed a cluster while Pseudomonas differed from them forming another cluster and nitrifying, Gram negative, phosphate-solubilising and starch-hydrolyzing bacteria formed another different cluster. This variation of the soil bacteria might be dependent on the microhabitat present in different locations of the study area.\n\nKeywords\nPopulation dynamicsANOVAShannon-Wiener IndexSimpson IndexPCAAHCissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nIn terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, soil is an important abiotic component that regulates the formation of assemblage of several interacting organisms, including microbes. Microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature and influence all known ecosystems on earth (Atlas and Bertha 1998). The ubiquity of microorganisms is attributed mainly to their small size, easy dispersal, adaptation to diverse habitats and ability to utilize wide variety of substrates as nutrient source (Pandey et al. 2007). The soil-dwelling microbes can be referred as the “Biological engine” of the earth as they play a pivotal role in many fundamental nutrient cycling processes, soil structure dynamics, pollution degradation and regulation of different plant communities (Breure 2004). Microbes are also responsible for soil aeration and soil fertility which are among the crucial aspects of soil function. Production of soil organic matter increases the capacity of the soil to maintain its functional structure once it is formed. The soil organic matter is directly derived from the combined biological activity of plants, microbes, animals and abiotic factors. Soil microbial community mainly consists of five major groups, i.e. bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, algae and protozoa (Holt 1986). Among them bacterial population is generally much higher than other groups (Alexander 1978). To understand the complexity of the interaction mediated by soil microbes, the evaluation of soil microbial diversity is essential. The determination of soil microbes is based on enumeration of laboratory culture of the isolates and also on 16S rDNA sequence analysis of the microbes (Seckbach 2000; Satyanarayana et al. 2005). Various works have been done on soil microbial diversity in different regions of India (Das and Dangar 2007, 2008; Chatterjee et al. 2007) but no such work on bacterial diversity has yet been done in the coastal areas of Digha, West Bengal, India. Coastal zone is the transitional zone between the terrestrial land and sea which are indeed unique places in our global geography, so various physical and topological parameters of the coastal areas should be maintainedd and observe periodically (Visalatchi and Raj Chandar 2012). Though the coastal areas of Digha is an important sea-shore region of India, it is neglected in terms of basic soil research. Previously no work was reported either on the population dynamics of the soil bacteria or on the relationship between soil microflora and soil physicochemical properties of coastal areas of Digha. In this context, the present study has been carried out to determine the diversity of soil bacteria and the physicochemical properties of the soil of different villages of the coastal areas of Digha, West Bengal, India.\n\nMaterials and methods\nSoil collection\nThe soil samples were collected from nine village areas of Midnapore coastal belt, West Bengal, India: [Padima (21°37′39.99″N, 87°29′28.81″E), Jatimati (21°37′40.90″N, 87°29′46.66″E), Chanpabani (21°37′39.89″N, 87°30′22.64″E), Palsandapur (21°37′30.36″N, 87°30′04.46″E), Bhagibaharampur (21°37′36.48″N, 87°30′44.42″E), Duttapur (21°36′57.78″N, 87°29′29.71″E), Gadadharpur (21°37′05.81″N, 87°30′04.41″E), Gobindabasan (21°37′36.23″N, 87°31′18.36″E) and Somaibasan (21°37′50.71″N, 87°32′11.37″E)] during November 2013–February 2014. The topmost soil (1 cm) was scrapped off and then about 100 g of soil from each area was collected in sterile polythene bags sealed with rubber bands.\n\nSoil analysis\nThe soil samples were taken to the Microbiology and Parasitology Research Laboratory, The University of Burdwan, for both physico-chemical and microbial analysis.\n\nTo determine the heterotrophic viable aerobic bacterial population, soil samples were diluted up to 10−5 and a 10 μl soil suspension (10−5) was mixed with 100 ml nutrient agar (peptone 5 g/l, beef extract 3 g/l, agar 2 g/l, pH 7) and incubated at 30 ± 1 °C in the BOD incubator. To determine different groups of bacteria separately, 10 μl of soil suspension (10−4) was mixed with 100 ml of different specific media distributed in five plates and incubated at 30 ± 1 °C in the BOD incubator. Soil suspension was pasteurized at 60 °C for 30 min for enrichment culture of the spore formers. The starch-hydrolyzing bacteria were enumerated by incubating the soil on starch agar media for 24 h and counting the number of bacterial colony producing halo zone after flooding with Gram’s iodine. The nitrifying bacteria were recorded after 5–30 days (5 day intervals) from the date of incubation. But all other groups of bacterial populations were counted after 3-day incubation. The aerobic heterotrophic and spore-forming bacteria were enumerated using nutrient agar media following the standard methods. To visualize Gram-negative bacteria, crystal violet (peptone 5 g/l, beef extract 3 g/l, lactose 10 g/l, crystal violet 0.0033 g/l, agar 15 g/l, pH 6.8 ± 0.1) was added to the medium before plating. Pseudomonas population were enumerated by incubating the soil suspension on Pseudomonas isolation agar [peptic digest of animal tissue 20 g/l, magnesium chloride 1.4 g/l, potassium sulfate 10 g/l, triclosan (Irgasan) 0.025 g/l, Agar 13.6 g/l, pH 7.0] for 72 h. Nitrifying bacteria was enumerated on Winogradsky’s medium containing (NH4)2SO4 (1.0 g/l) and the colonies were visualized (pink colour) by flooding the plates with sulphanilic acid reagent. The inorganic phosphate solubilizing bacteria were determined from the halo zone formation around the colonies on the insoluble phosphate [Ca3(PO4)2] containing medium. The asymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria were counted on nitrogen-free medium (Pelczar et al. 1957; Lacey 1997; Chatterjee et al. 2014). The physico-chemical parameters of the soil samples were measured following the standard methods (Issac and Johnson 1984; Sumner and Miller 1996; Evangelou 1998).\n\nStatistical analyses\nShannon-Wiener Index and Simpson Index were calculated to determine the species diversity and richness of the bacterial population of the soil samples collected from coastal areas of Digha. The data obtained on the different groups of bacteria present in the soil samples of Digha were subjected to agglomerative hierarchial cluster analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to represent a relationship between the various groups of bacteria (Manly 1994; Zar 1999; Kinnear and Gray 2000).\n\nResult\nIn the village areas of the coastal areas of Digha, the aerobic heterotrophic, Gram negative, spore-forming, starch-hydrolyzing, Pseudomonas, nitrate-reducing, de nitrifying, asymbiotic N2 fixing, nitrifying, phosphate-solubilizing bacterial populations ranged from 1.22 to 2.67 × 106, 0.09–1.63 × 105, 1.53–3.68 × 105, 2.22–4.06 × 105, 0.02–0.04 × 105, 0.35–1.33 × 105, 0.07–0.82 × 105, 0.58–2.50 × 105, 0.13–2.35 × 105, 0.05–1.9 × 105 cfu/g dry soil, respectively (Table 1). In soil samples of Palsandapur, aerobic heterotrophic population, Gram-negative and phosphate-solubilising bacterial population were higher than in other regions of the study area. The spore-forming bacterial population was found to be higher in the soil samples of Chanpabani than that of Padima, Jatimati, Palsandapur, Bhagibaharampur, Duttapur, Gadadharpur, Gobindabasan and Somaibasan. The soil samples of Gadadharpur area contained higher number of starch-hydrolyzing, Pseudomonas and asymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria than other villages of the present study area. Nitrate-reducing and de nitrifying bacterial population were comparatively higher in Jatimati village in respect of other villages of the study sites. In soil samples of Gobindabasan area, the nitrifying bacterial population was higher than that in Padima, Jatimati, Chanpabani, Palsandapur, Bhagibaharampur, Duttapur, Gadadharpur and Somaibasan area. The organic carbon content of the soil samples ranged from 0.61 to 0.93 % and found to be higher in soil samples of Palsandapur (0.93 %) than other villages of the study area. The available nitrogen in the soils of the study area varied from 11.2 to 29.5 mg/kg and was highest in Gadadharpur area (29.5 mg/kg). The available phosphate content in the soil samples of the coastal areas of Digha ranged from 230.8 to 503.09 mg/kg. In the Palsandapur area, the phosphate content was much higher (503.09 mg/kg) than other villages of our study area. The soil salinity ranged between 5.2 and 23.2 ds/m in the study area. The soil salinity was found to be lower in Palsandapur area and was comparatively higher in Gobindabasan area (Table 2). The results of the one-way ANOVA revealed significant variations (p < 0.05) in the microbial diversity with respect to different locations of the study site. Agglometric hierarchial cluster analysis (AHC) in respect of the number of different bacterial groups in different places of the study area showed that the denitrifying, nitrate-reducing, asymbiotic nitrogen-fixing and spore-forming bacteria formed a cluster in respect of their distribution pattern while Pseudomonas differed from them forming another cluster. Nitrifying, Gram-negative, phosphate-solubilising and starch-hydrolyzing bacteria formed a different cluster (Fig. 1). From principal component analysis (PCA) three components were extracted having the Eigen values of 3.541, 1.603 and 1.391, respectively, that explained more than 72 % (component 1—39.35 %, component 2—17.8 % and component 3—15.45 %) of the variance on the microbial abundance in the soil samples of the coastal areas of Digha (Table 3; Fig. 2). The bacterial groups were plotted on quadrant plot and among the four quadrants, starch-hydrolyzing bacteria were on the first quadrant, the second quadrant comprised of phosphate-solubilising, Gram-negative and nitrifying bacterial groups. Spore-forming, nitrate-reducing and denitrifying bacteria were in the third quadrant and the fourth quadrant contained Pseudomonas and asymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Fig. 3). Shannon-Wiener and Simpson Index of the study areas ranged from 1.56 to 1.88 and 3.85–5.73, respectively. Jatimati showed comparatively higher diversity index among the villages of the study area (Table 4).Table 1 Population dynamics [(cfu ± SE)/g dry soil] of different microbes in soil samples of coastal areas of Digha, West Bengal, India\n\nBacterial population\tPadima\tJatimati\tChanpabani\tPalsandapur\tBhagibaharampur\tDuttapur\tGadadharpur\tGobindabasan\tSomaibasan\t\nHeterotrophic (106)\t1.53 ± 0.06\t1.54 ± 0.024\t1.36 ± 0.034\t2.67 ± 0.037\t1.58 ± 0.036\t2.38 ± 0.032\t1.51 ± 0.059\t1.22 ± 0.062\t2.52 ± 0.067\t\nGram-negative (105)\t1.27 ± 0.05\t0.656 ± 0.034\t0.094 ± 0.003\t1.63 ± 0.037\t0.456 ± 0.047\t0.722 ± 0.055\t0.544 ± 0.038\t1.3 ± 0.069\t1.62 ± 0.06\t\nSpore-forming (105)\t3.29 ± 0.08\t2.9 ± 0.1\t3.68 ± 0.068\t2.51 ± 0.166\t3.18 ± 0.091\t3.66 ± 0.067\t3.04 ± 0.138\t1.53 ± 0.112\t3.53 ± 0.122\t\nStarch-hydrolyzing (105)\t3.30 ± 0.08\t3.39 ± 0.048\t3.33 ± 0.05\t3.89 ± 0.079\t3.4 ± 0.097\t2.22 ± 0.062\t4.07 ± 0.098\t3.83 ± 0.096\t3.18 ± 0.148\t\nPseudomonas (105)\t0.020 ± 0.002\t0.016 ± 0.003\t0.043 ± 0.002\t0.026 ± 0.003\t0.024 ± 0.005\t0.024 ± 0.003\t0.046 ± 0.003\t0.037 ± 0.004\t0.021 ± 0.004\t\nNitrate-reducing (105)\t0.48 ± 0.008\t1.33 ± 0.047\t0.576 ± 0.016\t0.402 ± 0.01\t0.508 ± 0.013\t0.508 ± 0.019\t0.373 ± 0.012\t0.351 ± 0.015\t0.457 ± 0.011\t\nDe nitrifying (105)\t0.80 ± 0.05\t0.822 ± 0.052\t0.556 ± 0.06\t0.072 ± 0.006\t0.344 ± 0.038\t0.323 ± 0.012\t0.622 ± 0.068\t0.264 ± 0.014\t0.544 ± 0.056\t\nAsymbiotic nitrogen-fixing (105)\t1.61 ± 0.05\t2.02 ± 0.08\t2.29 ± 0.123\t0.6 ± 0.029\t0.733 ± 0.062\t2.31 ± 0.096\t2.5 ± 0.133\t1.02 ± 0.032\t0.578 ± 0.028\t\nNitrifying (105)\t1.20 ± 0.06\t1.49 ± 0.092\t0.29 ± 0.011\t2.11 ± 0.075\t0.544 ± 0.029\t0.133 ± 0.012\t0.367 ± 0.029\t2.36 ± 0.103\t1.31 ± 0.087\t\nPhosphate solubilizing (105)\t0.46 ± 0.024\t0.299 ± 0.012\t0.081 ± 0.007\t1.9 ± 0.133\t0.251 ± 0.01\t0.311 ± 0.009\t0.07 ± 0.007\t0.24 ± 0.01\t0.054 ± 0.006\t\nResults are mean of nine replication ± SE\n\n\ncfu colony-forming unit\n\nTable 2 Physico-chemical parameters of the soil samples collected from different areas of coastal areas of Digha, West Bengal\n\nPlace\tOrganic carbon (%)\tNitrogen (mg/kg)\tPhosphate (mg/kg)\tSalinity (ds/m)\t\nPadima\t0.71\t21.32\t245.26\t9.7\t\nJatimati\t0.85\t29.4\t244.78\t10.3\t\nChanpabani\t0.68\t20.12\t230.91\t11.2\t\nPalsandapur\t0.93\t18.75\t503.09\t5.2\t\nBhagibaharampur\t0.83\t12.6\t243.81\t10.6\t\nDuttapur\t0.90\t16.5\t244.92\t20.8\t\nGadadharpur\t0.85\t29.5\t230.75\t15.2\t\nGobindabasan\t0.61\t11.2\t243.8\t23.2\t\nSomaibasan\t0.89\t23.2\t230.8\t18.7\t\nFig. 1 Agglometric hierarchical cluster analysis of the soil bacterial isolates of different villages of Digha, West Bengal\n\nTable 3 Eigenvalues extracted from the Principal Component Analysis\n\n\tF1\tF2\tF3\t\n Eigenvalue\t3.541\t1.603\t1.391\t\n Variability (%)\t39.349\t17.808\t15.456\t\n Cumulative %\t39.349\t57.156\t72.613\t\nFig. 2 Scree plot derived from PCA regarding the bacterial isolates of the collected soil samples of coastal areas of Digha, West Bengal, India\n\nFig. 3 Quadrant distribution of the soil bacterial isolates of the coastal areas of Digha, West Bengal, via PCA. anfb asymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, pb\nPseudomonas bacteria, shb starch-hydrolyzing bacteria, psb phosphate-solubilising bacteria, nfb nitrifying bacteria, gnb Gram-negative bacteria, nrb nitrate-reducing bacteria, dnb denitrifying bacteria, sfb spore-forming bacteria\n\nTable 4 Soil bacterial diversity indices of different villages of coastal areas of Digha, West Bengal, India\n\nPlace\tShannon-Wiener Index\tSimpson’s index\t\nPadima\t1.8614581\t5.4290517\t\nJatimati\t1.8814364\t5.726694\t\nChanpabani\t1.5576826\t3.9089861\t\nPalsandapur\t1.7972952\t5.2850797\t\nBhagibaharampur\t1.6336093\t3.8501342\t\nDuttapur\t1.6592783\t4.231307\t\nGadadharpur\t1.6203932\t4.0984608\t\nGobindabasan\t1.7516001\t4.6757094\t\nSomaibasan\t1.7141768\t4.5963072\t\n\n\nDiscussion\nPhysicochemical properties of soil, such as textures, water holding capacity, pH, organic matter content, etc. can influence microbial community structure by providing specific habitats for specific microorganisms (Chatterjee et al. 2014). The soil-inhabiting microorganisms play a vital role in regulating soil function by contributing to soil structure formation (Wright and Upadhyaya 1998; Dodd et al. 2000), plant nutrition (George et al. 1995; Timonen et al. 1996), plant health (Srivastava et al.1996; Filion et al. 1999) and soil fertility (Yao et al. 2000; O’Donnell et al. 2001). So quantitative and qualitative assay of soil microbes is an essential part in characterization of soil (Arunachalam and Arunachalam 2000). Ranjard and Richaume (2001) have done such characterization in France. Das et al. (1997) and Das and Dangar (2008) have studied the microbial diversity in the soils of Himalayan region and saline soils of rice field of coastal Orissa. In the present study, viable plate count method was adopted to assess the microbial diversity in the soil samples. In coastal areas of Digha, the aerobic heterotrophic bacterial population was quite lower than that in forest soil, agricultural and botanic soils of different parts of India. It was previously recorded that the heterotrophic bacterial population was found to be lower in sandy soils due to lower organic content than clay or humus soils (Kaur and singh 2000). The higher salinity might also be the reason of lower density of heterotrophic bacteria in coastal saline soils. Gram-positive bacterial Population was generally higher than Gram-negative bacterial Population, probably due to the ability of Gram-positive bacteria to form endospores and develop other stress response mechanisms (Hecker et al. 2007). Aerobic endospore-formers were found to be important in the soil nutrient cycle, such as the nitrogen cycle was influenced by denitrifiers, nitrogen fixers and organic nitrogen degraders; so as the sulphur cycle by sulphur oxidizers; and in transformation of other soil nutrients, such as manganese reduction. The abilities of the spore-forming bacteria to break down cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectins would suggest their roles in mineralization of plant material and humic material, while chitinase activity might help in degradation of fungal cell walls and insect exoskeletons (Mandic-Mulec and James 2011). In this study it was observed that spore-forming bacteria clustered with denitrifying, nitrate reducing with asymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Fig. 1). May be the spore-forming isolates provided nutrients that help these other organisms to grow. According to van Gestel et al. (1996), the vicinity between microbes, organic matter and clay is required for the survival of microbes, in which the organic matter and clay particles provide substrates to live in and nutrients to grow and function. In a study in Orissa, Dangar et al. (2010) found that denitrifying bacterial population was high in flooded or water saturated soil. Probably moisture content was inversely and organic content was directly related to the density of microbial population (Pankhurst et al. 1996; Reichardt et al. 2001). In Palsandapur area, the phosphate content was much higher than in other places of the study sites (Table 2) that might favour the growth of phosphate-solubilising bacteria in this soil. The higher nitrogen content in Gadadharpur soil sample might be due to the high density of asymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in that soil. Asymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria could fix the nitrogen as nitrate which increased the nitrogen availability in soil. Shannon-Wiener Index and Simpson Index showed that Jatimati area was most diversified area in respect of soil microbial diversity among all the studied areas. The higher organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphate content of this area provided an apt environment for the bacterial communities. The ANOVA result indicated a variation in the relative density of the microbes present in the soils sampled during the study (p < 0.05). This variation was dependent on the microhabitat they were provided in different locations of the study area. The AHC analysis revealed the correlation between the bacterial groups in terms to their relative density which was further justified by PCA. The PCA helped to understand the correlation between the different bacterial groups based on their abundance in different soil samples of the coastal areas of Digha. Gomoryova et al. (1999) assessed the distribution of functional groups of microbes via BIOLOG analysis, and his further analysis concluded that two environmental variables, i.e. tree influence potential and organic carbon content of soil, significantly influenced the microbial composition of a particular soil.\n\nConclusion\nThis study can be considered as a promising start for identification and distribution of various bacterial families in different soil samples of the coastal areas of Digha, West Bengal, India. Though this is a preliminary work regarding the assessment of bacterial diversity, it can be helpful for further specific identification and characterization of the bacterial communities inhabiting the coastal area. The diversity of spore-forming bacteria in this area increases the chance of the availability of potential insect pathogens which may be helpful in the studies regarding biocontrol.\n\nAuthors are grateful to University Grants Commission (MANF).

The activities of the selected soil enzymes were determined by incubating the selected fungicides-treated (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1) and -untreated groundnut soil samples at 10 day intervals. By determining the effective concentration, the rate of selected enzyme activity was estimated by adding the suitable substrate at 10, 20, 30 and 40 days of soil incubation. Both the enzyme activities were increased up to 5.0 kg ha−1 level of fungicide in both soil samples significantly at 10 days of soil incubation and further enhanced up to 20 days of incubation. The activity of the phosphatase and urease decreased progressively at 30 and 40 days of incubation. From overall studies, higher concentrations (7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1) of both tebuconazole and copper hydroxide were toxic to phosphatase and urease activities, respectively, in both soil samples.\n\nKeywords\nCopper hydroxideGroundnut soilsPhosphataseTebuconazoleUreaseissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nIn India, it has become a common trend in modern agriculture to apply agrochemicals such as pesticides to increase agricultural productivity and has become an integral part of agriculture. About one-third of the world’s food crop is destroyed by pests annually (Punitha et al. 2012). Different groups of pesticides with various formulations have been introduced into agricultural soils either simultaneously or in succession to protect crops from weeds, insects, and fungi. Pesticides have beneficial impacts in improving and stabilizing agricultural productivity by controlling pests; however, these organic chemicals may contaminate the soil ecosystem and various groups of organisms in soil, which play a vital role in mineralization, nitrification and phosphorus recycling. Among the different groups of organisms, microorganisms play an important role in many soil biological processes; soil enzymes play various biochemical functions in the overall process of organic matter decomposition in the soil system (Burns 1983; Sinsabaugh et al. 1991). The soil activities undergo complex biochemical processes that consist of integrated and ecologically connected synthetic processes, immobilization and enzyme stability (Khaziyev and Gulke 1991). Many investigations were performed to study the effect of various pesticides on different enzyme activities in soils of different origin (Sannino and Gianfreda 2001). The application of various pesticides may adversely affect not only the soil microflora but also soil enzymes and physico-chemical properties such as pH, salinity and alkalinity that cause damage to the fertility of the soil. The enzymatic activities in soil are mainly from microbial origin, and are derived from intracellular, cell associated or free enzymes (Mohiuddin and Mohammed 2014). Therefore, it is clear that there is a close relationship between pesticides and microorganisms, because these chemicals may have a deleterious effect on non-target microorganisms and most of these pesticides could be metabolized by different microorganisms resulting in the modification of their activity (Walia et al. 2014).\n\nIndia, Anantapuramu, a semiarid region of Andhra Pradesh, ranks first in the area of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cultivation, but its productivity is low and fluctuates around 9 q ha−1 on average (Anonymous 2014). Groundnut is one of the important major profitable oil seed crop grown throughout the year in India (Guha and Chandrasekhar 2001) and contributes to 41.3 % of the country’s oilseed production (Giraddi et al. 1999). The monocropping of groundnut with high-yielding varieties resulted in an eruption of fungi, causing damage to groundnut crop in many areas of Andhra Pradesh; more than 90 insect pests and mites were found to be associated with the groundnut crop (Das et al. 1995). To protest the groundnut crop loss and to get higher yield, the chemical use of pesticides has become an essential part in modern agriculture (Parama et al. 1997). Reports were available on the influence of pesticides on microbial activity with a different methodological approach (Gianfreda et al. 1994, 1995; Sannino and Gianfreda 2001).\n\nIn the present work, the influence of two fungicides, tebuconazole and copper hydroxide, on the activities of phosphatase and urease enzymes of selected soil samples were investigated. These two enzymes have been selected because they play an important role in the carbon–nitrogen and phosphorus–sulfur cycles in soils. Phosphatase, which is an exracellular enzyme produced by many soil microorganisms, is responsible for the hydrolysis of organic phosphorus compounds to inorganic phosphorus (Monkiedje and Spiteller 2002). Phosphatase carries out a broad range of intracellular as well as soil-accumulated activities that catalyze the hydrolysis of both the esters and anhydrides of phosphoric acid. Urease in general helps to maintain nitrogen in the form of ammonia (NH4+) and is less leachable (Srinivasulu and Rangaswamy 2014). Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to CO2 and NH4+ ions by acting on C–N non-peptide bonds in linear amides (Ramudu et al. 2012). Urease in particular is a useful indicator to evaluate soil pollution. The application of pesticides to soil decreases the urease activity that reduces the hydrolysis of urea which is beneficial to soil fertility (Anuradha et al. 2015).\n\nMany synthetic fungicides were developed in the 1940–1950s based on ‘old fungicide chemistry’ (Wightwick et al. 2013). These fungicides have a broad-spectrum multisite mode of action and are applied at high concentration rates. Many other fungicides were developed since 1970 based on ‘modern fungicide chemistry’, which have specific modes of action, and greater activity was applied at relatively lower application rates (Russell 2005). Few laboratory studies have been reported on the impact of fungicides on soil enzyme activity with contradictory effects. In the present study, a triazole fungicide tebuconazole and copper-based fungicide copper hydroxide were used based on their efficacy on soil enzymes. Tebuconazole, which is a systemic fungicide with protective action, is used as a spray that controls the leaf spot of groundnut. It is a potent xenobiotic to which exposure can cause metabolic alterations and lead to death of different organisms (Sehnem et al. 2010). The IUPAC name of tebuconazole is [(RS)-1-p-chlorophenyl-4,-dimethyl-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl) pentan-3-ol] (Potter et al. 2005). Copper-based fungicides that cause reduction in the populations of fungi and actinomycetes and inhibit nitrification, as well as to stimulate bacterial populations have been reported (Hussain et al. 2009; Lo 2010). In addition, copper hydroxide was selected as it represents a traditional Cu-based fungicide that has been in use for over 50 years in many parts of the world.\n\nWith this view, a laboratory study was conducted on the effect of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide on phosphatase and urease enzyme activities in selected soil samples. A little information is available on the behavior of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide on soil enzyme activities. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the response of the selected fungicides on phosphatase and urease enzyme activities. Hence in the present laboratory experiment, attempts were made to update the effect of selected fungicides on phosphatase and urease enzyme activities in groundnut soils, the major crop grown in Anantapuramu District, Andhra Pradesh, India.\n\nMaterials and methods\nSoils used in the present study\nTwo soil samples, a black clay soil and red sandy loam soil, were collected from groundnut-cultivated fields of Anantapuramu District, Andhra Pradesh, India. Soil samples with a known history of pesticide use were chosen from a depth of 12 cm and mixed thoroughly to prepare a homogenous composite sample, air-dried at room temperature and sieved through a 2 mm sieve and stored at 4 °C.\n\nAnalysis of the physico-chemical characteristics of soil samples\nMineral matter of soil samples such as sand, silt and clay contents were analyzed with the use of different sizes of sieves by following the method of Alexander (1961). Water-holding capacity (WHC) of the soil samples was determined by adding distilled water up to the saturation point and then 60 % water-holding capacity of the soil samples was calculated by Johnson and Ulrich (1960). The pH of the soil samples was determined by mixing soil and water in the ratio of 1:1.25 using Systonics digital pH meter with calomel glass electrode assembly. Organic carbon content in soil samples was estimated by Walkey–Black method and the organic matter was calculated by multiplying the values with 1.72 (Jackson 1971). The electrical conductivity of soil samples after addition of 100 ml distilled water to 1 g soil samples was measured by a conductivity bridge. The total nitrogen content in soil samples was determined by the method reported by Jackson (1971). The inorganic ammonium-nitrogen content in soil samples after extraction of 1 M KCl by the Nesslerization method Jackson (1971) and the contents of nitrite-nitrogen were determined by the method reported by Barnes and Folkard (1951), and the contents of nitrate-nitrogen by Brucine method Ranney and Bartlett (1972) after extraction with distilled water were determined. The important physico-chemical characters of the two soil samples are listed in Table 1.Table 1 Physico-chemical properties of soils used in the present study\n\nProperties\tBlack clay soil\tRed sandy loam soil\t\nSand (%)\t72.6\t53.4\t\nSilt (%)\t18.3\t27.8\t\nClay (%)\t9.1\t18.8\t\npHa\n\t7.8\t6.5\t\nWater-holding capacity (ml g−1 soil)\t0.43\t0.23\t\nElectric conductivity (m mhos)\t264\t228\t\nOrganic matterb (%)\t1.206\t0.67\t\nTotal nitrogenc (%)\t0.078\t0.045\t\nNH4\n+-N (µg g−1 soil)d\n\t7.09\t6.01\t\nNO2\n−-N (µg g−1 soil)e\n\t0.62\t0.48\t\nNO3\n−-N (µg g−1 soil)f\n\t0.98\t0.81\t\n\na1:1.25 (soil:water)\n\n\nbWalkley–Black method (Jackson 1971)\n\n\ncMicro-Kjeldhal method (Jackson 1971)\n\n\ndNesslerization method (Jackson 1971)\n\n\neDiazotization method (Barnes and Folkard 1951)\n\n\nfBrucine method (Ranney and Bartlett 1972)\n\n\n\nFungicides used in the in the present study\nFungicides, tebuconazole (25.9 % m/m EC a soluble liquid) obtained from Makheshim-Agan, India, and copper hydroxide (77 % WP soluble powder) obtained from Bayer’s Science, India, of commercial grades were used for experimental purpose.\n\nEnzymes used in the present study\nPhosphatase activity (E.C. 3.1.1.1)\nThe activity of phosphatase under the influence of the fungicides at different concentrations was determined in black clay and red sandy loam soils. Two gram portions of soil samples were transferred into test tubes (12 × 125 mm) were treated with two fungicides to provide final concentrations of 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 µg g−1 soil (equivalent to 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1 field application rates). The soil samples without fungicide treatment served as control. All the treatments including controls were incubated in the laboratory at 28 ± 4 °C by maintaining 60 % water-holding capacity. After 10 days of incubation period, triplicate soil samples were withdrawn for the assay of phosphatase (Tabatabai and Bremner 1969; Srinivasulu et al. 2012). Similarly, the influence of the two insecticides at stimulatory concentration (5.0 kg ha−1) on the rate of phosphatase activity in two different soils was also determined in triplicate soil samples at 10, 20, 30 and 40 days of incubation.\n\nAssay of phosphatase\nFor the assay of phosphatase activity, each soil sample was treated with 6 ml of 0.1 M maleate buffer (pH 6.5) and 2 ml of 0.03 M p-nitrophenyl phosphate and the tubes incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the tubes were placed on ice before the soil extracts were passed through Whatman No.1 filter paper. To suitable aliquots of the extract, 1 ml of 5 M CaCl2 and 4 ml of 0.05 M NaOH were added and the yellow color developed was read at 405 nm in a spectrophotometer (Milton Roy Company).\n\nUrease activity (EC. 3.5.1.5)\nFor estimating the enzymatic activity of urease, 1 g portions of soil samples (black clay and red sandy loam soils) placed in 15 × 150 mm test tubes were treated with 1 ml of aqueous solutions of two fungicides to provide different concentrations of 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1. The soil samples without insecticide treatment served as control. All the treatments including control were maintained at 60 % WHC and the tubes were incubated at 28 ± 4 °C. After 10 days of incubation, triplicate soil samples were withdrawn for the assay of urease.\n\nAssay of urease\nFawcett and Scott (1960) described the assay of urease at the desired intervals; 1 ml of 3 % urea and 2 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) were added to 1 g soil and the tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a water bath. After incubation, the tubes were shaked and placed in ice until the ammonia was extracted with 10 ml of 2 M KCl. 5 ml of phenol–sodium nitroprusside solution and 3 ml of 0.02 M sodium hypochlorite were added to 4 ml of the filtrate. The mixture was shaken, incubated for 30 min in dark and the developed blue color was measured at 630 nm in a Spectronic 20 D spectrophotometer. After determining the effective concentration, the experiment was carried out further for 20, 30 and 40 days and assayed similarly.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe concentrations of the phosphatase and urease enzymes were calculated on soil weight (over dried) basis. The insecticide treatments with untreated controls and the significant levels p ≤ 0.05 between the values of each sampling for each fungicide were obtained using SYSTAT statistical software package to find the results of Duncan’s multiple range (DMR) test (Megharaj et al.1999).\n\nResults and discussion\nFrom the laboratory experiments, it was observed that there exists a relationship between soil enzymatic activities and the selected fungicide concentrations in the selected soil samples. On hydrolysis, the substrate p-nitrophenyl disodium orthophosphate was added, phosphatase was increased in both the selected soil samples with the selected fungicides tebuconazole and copper hydroxide than in the control at 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 kg ha−1 levels, incubated for 20 days. Our investigation revealed that phosphatase and urease activities were drastically decreased at higher concentrations (7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1) of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide-treated soils than the untreated controls throughout the experiment. The data obtained from these experiments are represented in Tables 2 and 3. The maximum enhancement in phosphatase activity over control was noticed in the black clay soil and red sandy loam soils at 20 days of incubation period. Further incubation periods, i.e., 30 and 40 days, the activity was decreased slowly in both the soil samples (Table 4).Table 2 Influence of selected fungicides on activity of phosphatase in black clay soil after 10 days\n\nFungicide concentration (kg ha−1)\tTebuconazole\tCoppe hydroxide\t\n0.0\t280 ± 4.52f (100)\t280 ± 4.52f (100)\t\n1.0\t370 ± 3.48d (132)\t420 ± 3.62d (142)\t\n2.5\t620 ± 2.94c (221)\t610 ± 2.97c (217)\t\n5.0\t900 ± 0.87a (321)\t870 ± 0.91a (310)\t\n7.5\t730 ± 2.16b (260)\t710 ± 2.42b (253)\t\n10.0\t300 ± .22e (107)\t430 ± 0.68e (153)\t\nµg of p-nitrophenol (PNP) g−1 soil formed after 24 h incubation with p-nitro phenyl phosphate (PNPP)\n\nFigures in parentheses indicate relative production percentages\n\nMeans, in each column, followed by the same letter are not significantly different (P ≤ 0.05) from each other according to Duncan’s multiple range (DMR) test\n\nTable 3 Influence of selected fungicides on the activity of phosphatase in red sandy loam soil after 10 days\n\nFungicide concentration (kg ha−1)\tTebuconazole\tCopper hydroxide\t\n0.0\t190 ± 3.14f (100)\t190 ± 1.35f (100)\t\n1.0\t310 ± 2.42d (163)\t350 ± 1.28d (183)\t\n2.5\t480 ± 3.62b (252)\t490 ± 3.46c (257)\t\n5.0\t890 ± 2.47a (468)\t840 ± 0.84a (442)\t\n7.5\t670 ± 1.86c (352)\t610 ± 0.48b (321)\t\n10.0\t240 ± 1.64e (126)\t290 ± 0.96e (152)\t\nµg of p-nitrophenol (PNP) g−1 soil formed after 24 h incubation with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP)\n\nFigures in parentheses indicate relative production percentages\n\nMeans in each column followed by the same letter are not significantly different (P ≤ 0.05) from each other according to Duncan’s multiple range (DMR) test\n\nTable 4 Influence of selected fungicides on urease activity in black clay soil after 10 days\n\nFungicide concentration (kg ha−1)\tTebuconazole\tCopper hydroxide\t\n0.0\t260 ± 2.47f (100)\t260 ± 1.85f (100)\t\n1.0\t410 ± 0.68d (157)\t420 ± 2.68e (161)\t\n2.5\t750 ± 2.81c (288)\t650 ± 2.31c (250)\t\n5.0\t920 ± 2.46a (353)\t800 ± 0.82a (307)\t\n7.5\t820 ± 2.46b (315)\t740 ± 0.97b (284)\t\n10.0\t380 ± 1.48e (146)\t350 ± 0.62d (134)\t\nµg ammonia g−1 soil formed after 30 min incubation at 37 °C with urea\n\nFigures, in parentheses, indicate relative production percentages\n\nMeans in each column followed by the same letter are not significantly different (P ≤ 0.05) from each other according to Duncan’s multiple range (DMR) test\n\n\n\nUrease activity, implicated in the hydrolysis of urea, was significantly enhanced by the tebuconazole and copper hydroxide selected up to 5.0 kg ha−1 in both the soil samples when compared with the controls. However, the higher concentrations (7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1) were toxic to the urease activity after 20 days of incubation period. The amount of ammonia formed from urea was more in soil samples treated with 2.5 and 5.0 kg ha−1 of tebuconazole, and copper hydroxide was maximum in black soil with tebuconazole and copper hydroxide at 5.0 kg ha−1. In the present experiment, higher levels of 7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1 of the selected fungicides inhibited urease activity in two soils after 30 and 40 days of incubation periods (Table 5).Table 5 Influence of selected fungicides on urease activity in red sandy loam soil after 10 days\n\nFungicide concentration (kg ha−1)\tTebuconazole\tCopper hydroxide\t\n0.0\t300 ± 1.94f (100)\t300 ± 2.42f (100)\t\n1.0\t490 ± 1.72d (163)\t430 ± 2.62d (143)\t\n2.5\t580 ± 1.29c (193)\t570 ± 0.85c (190)\t\n5.0\t910 ± 1.93a (303)\t770 ± 2.48a (256)\t\n7.5\t690 ± 2.56b (230)\t680 ± 1.91b (226)\t\n10.0\t420 ± 3.62e (140)\t470 ± 0.74e (156)\t\nµg ammonia g−1 soil formed after 30 min incubation at 37 °C with urea\n\nFigures in parentheses indicate relative production percentages\n\nMeans, in each column, followed by the same letter are not significantly different (P ≤ 0.05) from each other according to Duncan’s multiple range (DMR) test\n\n\n\nPhosphatase activity\nFrom the results obtained from the present study, about 32–221 and 42–210 % increase in phosphatase activity over the control was noticed in the black soil with 20 days of incubation, whereas in the case of red sandy loam soil, the corresponding figures of the percentage enhancement by the two selected fungicides at two levels were 63–368 and 83–342 % during the same period of incubation. In comparison, tebuconazole at 5.0 kg ha−1 produced maximum stimulation in phosphatase activity in black clay soil than red sandy loam soil. At higher concentrations, i.e., 7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1, phosphatase activity was significantly inhibited by treating the selected soil samples with both the selected fungicides. Among the two fungicide treatments, tebuconazole produced a different stimulation over the control. In the present study, comparatively, black soil showed higher enzyme activity than red soil throughout the experiment. Phosphatase activity was significantly inhibited at higher concentrations, i.e., 7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1 in both the fungicide treatments, gradually with the incubation periods, i.e., 20, 30 and 40 days (Rangaswamy and Venkateswarlu 1996). Therefore in the present experiment, the maximum inhibition was recorded after 30 and 40 days of incubation periods. The enhancement in phosphatase activity over control was noticed in the black soil after 20 days of incubation. In the case of red sandy loam soil, the enhancement by the selected fungicides was also obtained at 5.0 kg ha−1 for 20 days of incubation and recorded in Table 2. The inhibitory effect was reduced upon further incubation, i.e., 30 and 40 days, due to the reduction in the concentration and degradation of the applied fungicides (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 \na, b Influence of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide on phosphatasea activity in black clay and red sandy loam soil at 5.0 kg ha−1. Asterisk µg of p-nitrophenol (PNP) g−1 soil formed after 24 h of incubation with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP), after 10, 20, 30 and 40 days of incubation. The values are the mean ± SE for each incubation period and are not significantly different (P ≤ 0.05) from each other according to Duncan’s multiple range (DMR) test\n\n\n\nGianfreda et al. (1994, 1995) and Tabatabai and Bremner (1969) described the enzymatic systems which stimulate free enzymes in the soil solution and enzyme–soil colloid associations were considered. The effects of some selected pesticides on the activity of these enzymatic systems were studied. The results clearly indicate that the initial days of application of fungicides drastically reduced the number of bacteria and beneficial microflora, i.e., phosphate solubilizing bacteria in fungicide-amended soils when compared with the control soil. Unlike the previous study, there was some reported inhibition of phosphatase activity by captan (Chen and Edwards 2001; Piotrowska-Seget et al. 2008). Walia et al. (2014) reported the results on phosphatase activity with mancozeb, indicating the maximum average phosphatase activity at zero ppm (121.8 U) and the average activity decreased significantly to 113.2 U at 100 ppm mancozeb concentration. As the incubation period increases, there was decreased average phosphatase activity with no significant difference between various tebuconazole and copper hydroxide concentrations used in the present study. The decrease in the enzyme activity may be due to the decrease in the microbial population, destruction or inactivation of preexisting soil enzymes and the substrate limiting for enzyme induction. From the present study, the process of phosphorus solubilization was not distributed by the selected fungicide treatment. Ahemad and Khan (2011) showed that P-solubilization was in a minor way affected at recommended doses, but majorly affected at higher doses of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide. This may be because the soil microbial population can solubilize the added insoluble phosphates and is enriched in the presence of higher concentrations of the selected fungicides. In addition to that, the total population of microorganisms was decreased and resulted in the lesser utilization of the released phosphorus. For instance, tebuconazole is a potent xenobiotic, the exposure to which can cause metabolic alterations and the death of different microorganisms (Sehnem et al.  2010). Wightwick et al. (2013) reported that the interactive effects of Cu on the toxicity of captan and trifloxystrobin to soil microbial functions are not known and the toxicity of the alternative synthetic organic fungicide compounds may be increased if they are additive effects with Cu. Exposure to prolonged Cu may result in the alteration of the susceptibility of soil microbial population to the additional stress caused by application of these synthetic fungicide compounds.\n\nUrease activity\nThe results obtained from the present study stated that there was about 57–253 and 61–207 % increase in the urease activity in black soil observed over the control. This was noticed in the black soil after 10 days of incubation period, whereas in the case of red sandy loam soil, the corresponding figures of the percentage enhancement by the two selected fungicides, tebuconazole and copper hydroxide, at two levels were 63–203 and 43–156 % during the same period of incubation. However on comparison of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide at 5.0 kg ha−1, tebuconazole produced maximum stimulation in urease activity in black clay soil than red sandy loam soil in the present study. At higher concentrations, i.e., 7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1, urease activity was significantly inhibited by treating the selected soil samples with both the selected fungicides. Among the two fungicide treatments, tebuconazole produced a different stimulation over control. In the present study, comparatively, the black soil showed higher enzyme activity than the red soil throughout the experiment. It can be concluded that the high enzymatic activities are associated with high organic matter content. Urease activity was significantly inhibited gradually at higher concentrations, i.e., 7.5 and 10.0 kg ha−1, in both the fungicide treatments with the incubation periods, i.e., 20, 30 and 40 days (Rangaswamy and Venkateswarlu 1996). In the present experiment, the maximum inhibition was recorded after 30 and 40 days of incubation periods. The inhibitory effect was reduced upon further incubation due to the reduction in the concentration and degradation of the applied fungicides. Ramudu et al. (2012) stated that the activity of urease, implicated in the hydrolysis of urea, was significantly enhanced under the impact of propiconazole and chlorothalonil up to 5.0 kg ha−1 level in both the soils. The two fungicides at 10, 25, 50 ppm levels individually cause 7–35 and 13–53 % increase in urease activity, respectively, compared to control in laterite soil and 28–54 and 12–52 %, respectively, compared to control in vertisol soil in a 10-day interval. For instance, Bending et al. (2007) reported that applications of azoxystrobin, tebuconazole and chlorothalonil affected the size and structure of microorganisms in the soils with low organic matter, but not in a comparable soil with high organic matter. The urease enzyme plays an important role in nitrogen cycling. Decrease in the enzyme activity results in the change in ion concentration, pH, and reduction of oxidation potential on solid organic and inorganic particles interspersed with mineral particles of larger size and inhibition of active site of urease enzyme by the selected fungicides. There have been reports on the effect of captan and trifloxystrobin on urease activity. The results obtained from the previous study suggest that the copper hydroxide alternatives, captan and trifloxystrobin, do not pose a short-term risk and are relatively more toxic than copper hydroxide to N cycling processes in soil. Similarly, urease activity was inhibited by napropamide at all concentrations relative to the control with long periods of pesticide application (Guo et al. 2008). In the same way, Cycon et al. (2010) noticed that urease activity declined in red sandy loamy soils with a combination (mancozeb + dimethomorph) at higher concentrations than control. Comparatively in the present study, the black soil showed higher urease activity than the red soil throughout the experiment due to its high organic matter content. Several studies reported that the stimulation of soil enzyme activities was associated with high organic matter content (Fig. 2).Fig. 2 \na, b Influence of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide on urease (asterisk) activity in black clay and red sandy loam soil at 5.0 kg ha. Asterisk µg ammonia g−1 soil formed after 30 min incubation at 37 °C with urea, after 10, 20, 30 and 40 days of incubation. The values are the mean ± SE for each incubation period and are not significantly different (P ≤ 0.05) from each other according to Duncan’s multiple range (DMR) test\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results of the present study clearly indicated that the two selected fungicides, tebuconazole and copper hydroxide, profoundly enhanced both the phosphatase and urease activities at 1.0–5.0 kg ha−1. Based on the above results, it is concluded that the microbial activities (i.e., enzyme activities) were not affected by the fungicides applied at recommended levels in the agricultural system to control the pests.\n\nWe are grateful to the University Grants Commission—BSR (RFSMS), New Delhi, India, for providing financial assistance.

Presence of RsMYB1 in transgenic lines was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results of reverse-transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of RsMYB1 was stable in all transgenic lines and could enhance the expression levels of three key biosynthetic genes (F3H, DFR, and ANS) involved in anthocyanin production. Accordingly, anthocyanin content was significantly higher in transgenic lines than in control of all the cultivars, although the increasement was not visually observed in any of the transgenic lines. Therefore, these results demonstrate that RsMYB1 has potential to enhance anthocyanin content in the chrysanthemums.\n\nKeywords\nAnthocyaninRT-PCRSpectrophotometerTranscription factorhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002531Kyungpook National University (KR)2014Naing Aung Htay issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nChrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. is one of the most important floricultural crops that occupies a prominent position in flower markets worldwide. In 2012, its cultivation area was 31 % of the total cut-flower cultivation area (1724 ha) in Korea (Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs, 2012), and it has been increasing on a yearly basis. In summer, the heat stress due to elevated temperatures causes degradation of anthocyanin accumulation in flower petals, leading to low flower quality that causes economic loss in chrysanthemum fields (Eun et al. 2008).\n\nTemperature has been considered as an important factor that influences anthocyanin biosynthesis in various plants, such as apple (Ubi et al. 2006; Lin-Wang et al. 2011), grape (Yamane et al. 2006), petunia (Shvarts et al. 1997), red orange (Lo Piero et al. 2005), and rose (Dela et al. 2003). Elevated temperatures decrease the accumulation of anthocyanin. Huh et al. (2008) claimed that flower coloration was observed in red chrysanthemum cultivars when they were grown at an elevated temperature (35 °C).\n\nGenetic engineering with MYB transcription factors has been used to enhance anthocyanin accumulation in several plant species, since MYB transcription factors up-regulated anthocyanin biosynthesis in tobacco, petunia, apple, rose, and lily (Espley et al. 2007; Lin-Wang et al. 2010; Pattanaik et al. 2010; Quattrocchio et al. 2006; Yamagishi et al. 2010). Pattanaik et al. (2010) reported that overexpression of MYB (NtAn2) in tobacco enhanced anthocyanin accumulation and expression levels of chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) genes. In apples, red fruit color is controlled by MdMYB10 (Espley et al. 2007). The purple phenotype of sweet potato is also strongly associated with IbMYB1, which induces all anthocyanin biosynthetic genes (Mano et al. 2007). LhMYB6 and LhMYB12 increase the expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and determine the accumulation of anthocyanin (Yamagishi et al. 2010). Radish MYB transcription factor belongs to the R2R3-MYB transcription factor family and is highly expressed in the skin and flesh of three radish cultivars (‘Seo Ho’, ‘Man Tang Hong’, and ‘Hong Feng No.1’); strong anthocyanin accumulation has been observed in the radish cultivars (Park et al. 2011). Expression of the MYB transcription factor in petunia enhanced the expression level of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes (CHI, CHS, F3H, DFR, and ANS) as well as anthocyanin accumulation in our previous studies. Since the main anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in chrysanthemum is the cyanidin-based pathway, CHS, CHI, F3H, DFR, and ANS are considered as the five key biosynthetic genes responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in chrysanthemums. Thus, it is quite interesting to investigate the role of RsMYB1 in anthocyanin accumulation in chrysanthemum.\n\nIn this study, we used three different red chrysanthemum cultivars that have been observed to show coloration in summer. RsMYB1 was introduced into the cultivars by using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes regulated by RsMYB and associated anthocyanin accumulation were analyzed.\n\nMaterials and methods\nThree red chrysanthemum cultivars (C. morifolium Ramat.), namely, ‘Peach ND’, ‘Peach Red’, and ‘Vivid scarlet’, were obtained from Gumi Research Station. The cultivars were then proliferated in vitro, according to the method described by Naing et al. (2015a). Briefly, shoot tips with about 1 cm2 in size were cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS; Duchefa Biochemie, Netherlands) containing 3 % (w/v) sucrose, 0.8 % plant agar, and 0.01 % activated charcoal. Then, the cultures were maintained at 25 ± 2 °C and a 16-h photoperiod (37 μmol m−2 s−1)\n\nPlasmid construction and transformation\nIn this study, Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 carrying a binary vector pB7WG2D with RsMYB1 isolated from radish (Raphanus sativus L.) was used. RsMYB1 was placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. In addition, the vector contained the gene bar for resistance to phosphinothricin (PPT) in transgenic plants.\n\nPrior to transformation, infection solution of Agrobacterium strain harboring the binary vector pB7WG2D were cultured as described by Naing et al. (2014), and transformation was performed according to protocol described by Naing et al. (2016). Briefly, 100 leaf segments (5 cm2) excised from in vitro plants of the three different cultivars were incubated in the Agrobacterium infection solution. The leaf segments were cultured on an MS co-cultivation medium with 0.5 mg L−1 of BA and 0.5 mg L−1 of NAA, 3 % sucrose, and 3 g L−1 of Gelrite (pH 5.8) and placed in the dark at 25 ± 2 °C for 3 days. Then, the leaf segments were cultured on the same medium containing 125 mg L−1 Clavamox (Zoetis, India) and placed in the dark at 25 ± 2 °C for 7 days. The leaf segments were further cultured on the same medium containing 1 mg L−1 of PPT and 125 mg L−1 of Clavamox under a 16-h photoperiod (37 μmol m−2 s−1). They were transferred to a fresh medium every 3 weeks to suppress Agrobacterium growth. After 6 weeks, green shoots resistant to PPT were collected and transferred to plant growth regulator-free MS medium with 1 mg L−1 PPT and 125 mg L−1 of Clavamox to assess plant growth. PPT-resistant plants that were 4–5 cm in size were transplanted to a tray with vermiculite soil and acclimatized in a greenhouse at 25 °C. The plantlets were then transferred to pots filled with peat soil and placed in the greenhouse.\n\nDNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction\nGenomic DNA was extracted from young leaves of 6-week-old plants selected using 1 mg L−1 PPT with the RBC HiYield™ Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Real Biotech Corporation, Taiwan), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA was then amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers and PCR conditions mentioned in Table 1. To detect presence of RsMYB1 and bar, amplified DNA was observed under UV (UVITEC Cambridge, UK) irradiation after electrophoresis for 30 min using 2 % agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide.Table 1 Primers and PCR conditions used in this study\n\nGene\tPrimer\tSize (bp)\tPCR condition\t\n\nRsMYB1\n\tF-ATG GAG GGT TCG TCC AAA GG\t700\t98 °C for 30 s, followed by 25 cycles including 10 min at 98 °C, 1 min at 98 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, and final elongation step at 72 °C for 1 min\t\nR-GAA ACA CTA ATC AAA TTA CAC AGT CTC TCC\t\n\nBar\n\tF-GGT CTG CAC CAT CGT\t496\t95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles including 20 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, and final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min\t\nR-TCA GAT TTC GGT GAC GGG CA\t\n\nCHS\n\tF-CAA CGG TTT TCT CCA TTA GGT\t299\t95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles including 20 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 57 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, and final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min\t\nR-GAG GAC CAC GGT TTC GAC\t\n\nCHI\n\tF-TGG TGC AAC CAT TGA CAA GT\t300\t95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles including 20 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 55.6 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, and final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min\t\nR-AAA TTT GGT TCA GCA TCT GTA GTT\t\n\nF3H\n\tF-ACC CGG TTC GTC CGT GAT GAG G\t804\t95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles including 20 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 64 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, and final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min\t\nR-TGC CTG GTG GTC CGC ATT CT\t\n\nDFR\n\tF-ATG AAA GAA GAC TCA CCA GCC A\t1048\t95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles including 20 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 59 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, and final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min\t\nR-CTT CGT GAG TGT CCG CCT TT\t\n\nANS\n\tF-ATA CAT CCG AAC ACA AGA TG\t432\t95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles including 20 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 60 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, and final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min\t\nR-AAT CGC TAG GTG TCG AGG GCC\t\n\nActin\n\tF-ACA ACG TTT TAC AAT GAG CTT CG\t196\t95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles including 20 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 57 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, and final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min\t\nR-CCG TTC AGC AGT TGT AGT AA\t\n\n\nRNA extraction and reverse transcription-PCR\nTo evaluate the expression level of RsMYB1 and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in the transgenic lines already confirmed using PCR, RNA of each line was extracted for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis. Prior to RNA extraction, all equipment, including reagent bottles, were cleaned using RNA eraser (MP Bio, USA). Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of leaf tissue of the transgenic and wild type chrysanthemum plants by using TRI Reagent™ Solution (Ambion, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA by using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers and PCR conditions for RsMYB1 remained unchanged, and those for the biosynthetic genes (CHI, CHS, F3H, DFR, and ANS) are listed in Table 1; Actin was used as the internal control. PCR products were observed under UV (UVITEC Cambridge, UK) irradiation after electrophoresis for 30 min using 2 % agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide.\n\nAnalysis of anthocyanin content\nTotal anthocyanin contents of the transgenic lines and control plants were analyzed according to the protocol used by Naing et al. (2015b), with some modifications. Briefly, approximately 500 mg of leaf materials excised from the plants grown in the greenhouse was crushed, and pigments were extracted with 5 mL of distilled water. They were then incubated overnight at 4 °C by adding 5 mL of 1 % (w/v) hydrochloric acid in methanol solution. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min and transferred to a 2 mL collection tube. Absorbance was measured at 430–630 nm by using a spectrophotometer (U-2800; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Anthocyanin content of each sample was calculated according to the method reported by Sung et al. (2013).\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor measurement of anthocyanin content, five samples from each plant (wild type and two independent transgenic lines) of the three chrysanthemum cultivars were detected. Data were analyzed using Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT) (p > 0.05).\n\nResults\nGeneration of chrysanthemum transgenic plants that express RsMYB1\nTo investigate whether RsMYB1 could enhance the expression level of biosynthetic genes responsible for anthocyanin biosynthesis, we produced two independent transgenic lines from the cultivars ‘Peach ND’, ‘Peach Red’, and ‘Vivid Scarlet’, in which the presence of the selection marker and transgene were detected using PCR (Fig. 1). Interestingly, enhanced anthocyanin expression was not observed in the transgenic plants of the cultivars. Thus, it was necessary to investigate the expression levels of the transgene and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes.Fig. 1 PCR detection of selection marker (bar), target (RsMYB1) genes in transgenic chrysanthemum (cvs. Peach ND (PN), Peach Red (PR), and Vivid Scarlet (VD) lines\n1 and 2\n\n\n\n\nExpression analysis of RsMYB1 and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes\nWe used the two independent transgenic lines derived from each cultivar to perform an expression analysis of RsMYB1 and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Results of RT-PCR showed that distinct and stable expression of RsMYB1 in all individual lines of the same genotype (Fig. 2), but its expression level was different along with different genotype tested. Surprisingly, distinct and stable expression of RsMYB1 in the cultivars did not enhance anthocyanin production.Fig. 2 RT-PCR analysis of RsMYB1 expression in the non-transgenic lines (wild type) and the transgenic lines of the chrysanthemum cultivars, namely, Peach ND (PN), Peach Red (PR), and Vivid Scarlet (VD)\n\n\n\nExpression analysis of biosynthetic genes by RT-PCR revealed that the key biosynthetic genes (CHI, CHS, F3H, DFR, and ANS) were expressed in all transgenic lines, including the control. However, expression of RsMYB1 in chrysanthemum could regulate the enhanced expression of the biosynthetic genes, in particular, F3H, DFR, and ANS, as compared to the expression of these genes in the control. Expression levels of other biosynthetic genes such as CHI and CHS did not differ between the controls and transgenic lines (Fig. 3). Interestingly, higher expression of RsMYB1 is not associated with that of biosynthetic genes in the transgenic lines because expression levels of biosynthetic genes in ‘Peach ND’, which contains low transcripts of RsMYB1, were slightly higher than those in ‘Peach Red’ and ‘Vivid Scarlet’, which express high transcripts of RsMYB1 (Figs. 2, 3).Fig. 3 RT-PCR analysis of the expression patterns of biosynthetic genes in non-transgenic lines (wild type) and two individual transgenic lines of the chrysanthemum cultivars, namely, Peach ND (PN), Peach Red (PR), and Vivid Scarlet (VD) containing RsMYB1\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of anthocyanin content\nAlthough variations in biosynthetic gene expression were observed between the controls and transgenic lines (Fig. 3), enhanced anthocyanin accumulation was not visually observed in the transgenic lines. Hence, we assumed that anthocyanin might have accumulated inside the leaves without being expressed phenotypically. However, when anthocyanin was extracted from the leaves of the transgenic lines and compared to the extracts from the control plants, only slight significant color difference was observed in ‘Peach Red’ and ‘Peach ND’ while a distinct variation was seen in ‘Vivid Scarlet’ (Fig. 4). This was further confirmed using spectrophotometry results, which were not consistent with the results for anthocyanin color in (Fig. 5) in ‘Peach Red’, ‘Peach ND’ because anthocyanin contents were observed to be significantly different in the cultivars (Fig. 5), where the contents in transgenic lines were approximately 0.01–0.015 mg g−1 higher than those in the controls, regardless of genotypes. Thus, higher expression levels of the three biosynthetic genes were associated with anthocyanin accumulation in the cultivars.Fig. 4 Comparative analysis of anthocyanin content between the non-transgenic lines (wild type) and transgenic lines of the chrysanthemum cultivars, namely, Peach ND (PN), Peach Red (PR), and Vivid Scarlet (VD) containing RsMYB1\n\n\nFig. 5 Spectrophotometeric analysis of anthocyanin content between the non-transgenic (wild type) and transgenic lines of the chrysanthemum cultivars, namely, Peach ND (PN), Peach Red (PR), and Vivid Scarlet (VD) containing RsMYB1. Bar stands for standard error. Means marked with same letter within the same cultivar are not significantly different\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nTranscription factors can regulate genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in various plants, including model plants and floricultural or food crops (Nishihara and Nakatsuka 2011). R2R3 MYB transcription factors, which regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis, cloned from petunia (Quattrocchio et al. 2006), apple, strawberry, plum and rose (Lin-Wang et al. 2010), lily (Yamagishi et al. 2010), snapdragon (Jackson et al. 1991), morning glory (Morita et al. 2006), gentian (Nakatsuka et al. 2008) and tobacco (Pattanaik et al. 2010) have been shown to regulate sets of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, we assumed that it is possible to use the radish RsMYB1 transcription factor, which belongs to the R2R3-MYB transcription factor family and was found to be highly expressed in the skin and flesh of three radish cultivars and responsible for anthocyanin accumulation (Park et al. 2011), to enhance anthocyanin biosynthesis in the chrysanthemum cultivars ‘Peach ND’, ‘Peach Red’, and ‘Vivid Scarlet’, which showed anthocyanin degradation under elevated temperatures.\n\nHere, we produced two individual transgenic lines from each cultivar. However, not all shoots that showed positive results for the introduced RsMYB1 exhibited anthocyanin-enhancing phenotypes. Butaye et al. (2005) claimed that this type of variation among individual transgenic plants/genotypes is often observed in plant transformation experiments and can be explained by variation in the expression of the introduced RsMYB1. Analysis of RsMYB1 expression in the transgenic lines was shown to be stable using RT-PCR; this was not consistent with the claim of Butaye et al. (2005).\n\nIn addition, many researchers have documented that anthocyanin accumulation in chrysanthemum correlated with the expression pattern of biosynthetic genes (Chen et al. 2012; He et al. 2013; Sung et al. 2013). Since the main anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in chrysanthemum is the cyanidin-based pathway (He et al. 2013), CHS, CHI, F3H, DFR, and ANS are considered as five key biosynthetic genes responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in chrysanthemum. Our results show that the expression of RsMYB1 in chrysanthemum could enhance the expression level of key biosynthetic genes (F3H, DFR, and ANS), although anthocyanin accumulation is not visible in the cultivars. However, analysis of anthocyanin content using a spectrophotometer revealed that anthocyanin contents in transgenic lines of the cultivars were significantly higher than those in the controls. Thus, anthocyanin accumulation in the cultivars was correlated with the expression pattern of biosynthetic genes as reported by the researchers (Chen et al. 2012; He et al. 2013; Sung et al. 2013), but anthocyanin content produced by RsMYB1 seemed to be genotype-dependent because enhancement of anthocyanin contents in cultivars ‘Peach ND’ and ‘Vivid Scarlet’ seemed to be higher than that in cultivar ‘Peach Red’ (Fig. 5). Quattrocchio et al. (1999) claimed that although MYB transcription factors could enhance anthocyanin production, different pigmentation control activities were observed in different species of Antirrhinum and Petunia. Moreover, different pigmentation effects of MYB transcription factors on berry skin color in grape (Kobayashi et al. 2004, 2005) and tuber color in potato (De Jong et al. 2004) have also been reported. There seems to be some variation in the ability of transcription factors to control anthocyanin production in different genotypes.\n\nColor pigmentation in petunia due to RsMYB1 was visually shown in our preliminary experiment (data not shown). In addition, enhancement of anthocyanin contents in the cultivars by RsMYB1 was observed in this study. However, the reason why increased anthocyanin content was not visually observed in the cultivars is unclear. One possible explanation is that anthocyanin contents induced by RsMYB1 was not dramatic in these cultivars. Another possible explanation is that the expression levels of F3H, DFR, and ANS were not high enough to enhance high anthocyanin content. Otherwise, it might be that expression of MYB transcription factor alone is not able to enhance strong anthocyanin accumulation in chrysanthemum, because the expression of MYB transcription factor alone failed to express anthocyanin in Arabidopsis and tobacco (Lloyd et al. 1992), and grape (Hichri et al. 2011). Alternatively, it also might be due to lack of basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) expression in the chrysanthemums because, in several other cases, co-expression of MYB transcription factor and a bHLH partner are required to strongly express anthocyanin (Butelli et al. 2008; Lloyd et al. 1992; Quattrocchio et al. 1998). Therefore, we will conduct further experiments to reveal the reason why increased anthocyanin was not visually observed in the transgenic chrysanthemums expressing RsMYB1.\n\nConclusions\nWe produced transgenic chrysanthemums that expressed RsMYB1 and demonstrated the effects of its ectopic expression on the expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. This study revealed that RsMYB1 could enhance the expression of the biosynthetic genes (F3H, DFR, and ANS) in transgenic lines of the cultivars Peach ND, Peach Red, and Vivid Scarlet and increase anthocyanin contents in the cultivars. The reason for the lack of visual enhancement in anthocyanin contents is still unknown. Accordingly, further studies on promoter functions and environmental conditions that affect the anthocyanin production pathway are necessary to understand the regulatory mechanism underlying anthocyanin biosynthesis. Overall, our study provides important information regarding the role of RsMYB1 in the regulation of key anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in chrysanthemums.\n\nThis study was supported by the Bio-industry Technology Development Program, Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Republic of Korea, and Kyungpook National University Research Fund, 2012.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nButaye K  Cammue B  Delauré S  De Bolle M   Approaches to minimize variation of transgenic expression in plants Mol Breed 2005 16 79 91 10.1007/s11032-005-4929-9 \nButelli E  Titta L  Giorgio M  Mock HP  Matros A  Peterek S  Schijlen EGWM  Hall RD  Bovy AG  Luo J  Martin C   Enrichment of tomato fruit with health-promoting anthocyanins by expression of select transcription factors Nat Biotechnol 2008 26 1301 1308 10.1038/nbt.1506 18953354 \nChen SM  Li CH  Zhu XR  Deng YM  Sun W  Wang LS  Chen FD  Zhang Z   The identification of flavonoids and the expression of genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the chrysanthemum flowers Biol Plant 2012 56 458 464 10.1007/s10535-012-0069-3 \nDe Jong WS  Eannetta NT  De Jong DM  Bodis M   Candidate gene analysis of anthocyanin pigmentation loci in the Solanaceae  Theor Appl Genet 2004 108 423 432 10.1007/s00122-003-1455-1 14523517 \nDela G  Or E  Ovadia R  Nissim-Levi A  Weiss D  Oren-Shamir M   Changes in anthocyanin concentration and composition in ‘Jaguar’ rose flowers due to transient high-temperature conditions Plant Sci 2003 164 333 340 10.1016/S0168-9452(02)00417-X \nEspley RV  Hellens RP  Putterill J  Stevenson DE  Kutty-Amma S  Allan AC   Red colouration in apple fruit is due to the activity of the MYB transcription factor, MdMYB10 Plant J 2007 49 414 427 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02964.x 17181777 \nEun JH  Hak KS  Seong YC  Oh GK  Young RL   Thermosusceptible developmental stage in anthocyanin accumulation and color response to high temperature in red chrysanthemum cultivars Korea J Hort Sci Technol 2008 26 357 361 \nHe H  Ke H  Keting H  Qiaoyan X  Silan D   Flower colour modification of chrysanthemum by suppression of F3′H  and overexpression of the exogenous Senecio cruentus F3′5′H  gene PLoS One 2013 8 e74395 10.1371/journal.pone.0074395 24250783 \nHichri I  Barrieu F  Bogs J  Kappel C  Delrot S  Lauvergeat V   Recent advances in the transcriptional regulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway J Exp Bot 2011 62 2465 2483 10.1093/jxb/erq442 21278228 \nJackson D  Culianez-Macia F  Prescott AG  Roberts K  Martin C   Expression patterns of myb genes from Antirrhinum flowers Plant Cell 1991 3 115 125 10.1105/tpc.3.2.115 1840903 \nKobayashi S  Goto-Yamamoto N  Hirochika H   Retrotransposon-induced mutations in grape skin color Science 2004 304 982 10.1126/science.1095011 15143274 \nKobayashi S  Goto-Yamamoto N  Hirochika H   Association of VvmybA1  gene expression with anthocyanin production in grape (Vitis vinifera ) skin-color mutants J Jpn Soc Hort Sci 2005 74 196 203 10.2503/jjshs.74.196 \nLin-Wang K  Bolitho K  Grafton K  Kortstee A  Karunairetnam S  McGhie TK  Espley RV  Hellens RP  Allan AC   An R2R3 MYB transcription factor associated with regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in Rosaceae Plant Biol 2010 10 50 \nLin-Wang K  Micheletti D  Palmer J  Volz R  Lozano L  Espley R  Hellens RP  Chagne D  Rowan DD  Troggio M  Iglesias I  Allan AC   High temperature reduces apple fruit colour via modulation of the anthocyanin regulatory complex Plant Cell Environ 2011 34 1176 1190 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02316.x 21410713 \nLloyd AM  Walbot V  Davis RW   Arabidopsis and Nicotiana anthocyanin production activated by maize regulators R and C1 Science 1992 258 1773 1775 10.1126/science.1465611 1465611 \nLo Piero AR  Puglisi I  Rapisarda P  Petrone G   Anthocyanins accumulation and related gene expression in red orange fruit induced by low temperature storage J Agric Food Chem 2005 53 9083 9088 10.1021/jf051609s 16277406 \nMano H  Ogasawara F  Sato K  Higo H  Minobe Y   Isolation of a regulatory gene of anthocyanin biosynthesis in tuberous roots of purple-fleshed sweet potato Plant Physiol 2007 143 1252 1268 10.1104/pp.106.094425 17208956 \nMorita Y  Saitoh M  Hoshino A  Nitasaka E  Iida S   Isolation of cDNAs for R2R3-MYB, bHLH and WDR transcriptional regulators and identification of c and ca mutations conferring white flowers in the Japanese morning glory Plant Cell Physiol 2006 47 457 470 10.1093/pcp/pcj012 16446312 \nNaing AH  Park KI  Lim SH  Kim CK   Appropriate choice of antibiotics for plant regeneration and optimization of selective agents to be used in genetic transformation of chrysanthemum Plant Omics 2014 7 237 243 \nNaing AH  Park KI  Chung MY  Lim KB  Kim CK   Optimization of factors affecting efficient shoot regeneration in chrysanthemum cv.

The primers for 16S rDNA, Pseudomonas-specific region and rpoD gene region were amplifying a region of 1492, 990 and 760 bp, respectively, from all the isolates investigated. The RFLP analysis of the PCR products resulted in a classification of these fluorescent pseudomonads which was best answered by rpoD-based RFLP analysis. The 22 FLPs were placed in two major clusters and seven subclusters suggesting that these were genotypically heterogenous and might belong to several species within Pseudomonas sensu stricto. Sequence analysis of these three genes for three selected isolates AS5, AS7 and AS15 showed 16S rDNA and Pseudomonas-specific gene region phylogenies were generally similar, but rpoD gene phylogeny was somewhat different from these two genes. These results were also congruent with the results of RFLP of these three genes. rpoD provided comparable phylogenetic resolution to that of the 16S rRNA and Pseudomonas-specific genes at all taxonomic levels, except between closely related organisms (species and subspecies levels), for which it provided better resolution. This is particularly relevant in the context of a growing number of studies focusing on subspecies diversity, in which single-copy protein-encoding genes such as rpoD could complement and better justify the information provided by the 16S rRNA gene. Hence rpoD can be used further as an evolutionary chronometer for species-level identification.\n\nKeywords\nPseudomonas16S rDNAGenus-specific generpoD geneSequence analysisMolecular taxonomyAICRP-PHT from ICAR, Government of Indiaissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nMolecular microbial ecology commenced in 1990 with the direct amplification and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from the environment (Giovannoni et al. 1990). This procedure revolutionized microbial ecology and permanently changed the way we study prokaryotes in the environment. rRNA genes could identify an organism by reconstructing its phylogeny, along with the possibility of storing sequences in databases, resulting in the rapid adoption of the 16S rRNA gene by microbiologists. However, none of the 16S rRNA-based molecular methods allows for an accurate representation of microbial communities. It is also created by the existence of multiple heterogeneous copies of the 16S rRNA gene within a genome (Crosby and Criddle 2003; Dahllof et al. 2000). It seems that the resolution of 16S rRNA-based analysis is low due to the small numbers of substitutions between compared 16S rRNA sequences. Some of the studies have identified organisms with identical 16S rRNA gene sequences that have significant sequence divergence in protein-encoding genes (Papke et al. 2003; Pernthaler and Pernthaler 2005). The use of a single-copy gene for community analysis is an important milestone in microbial ecology, as it could allow for the accurate measurement of diversity and phylogenetic relationships, avoiding a loss in phylogenetic resolution and biases in diversity measurements due to the presence of intragenomic heterogeneity (Case et al. 2006). To resolve the phylogenetic relationships of closely related organisms, it would be necessary to use other gene sequences which provide a higher resolution than that of 16S rRNA. A rapid and accurate system for the identification of Pseudomonas isolates is essential in order to determine or monitor their role in the environment. Yamamoto et al. (2000) proposed the analysis of protein-encoding genes (gyrB and rpoD) for the discrimination of Pseudomonas species. These genes evolve much faster than rRNAs and provide higher resolution than the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. In addition to their utility in the identification of Pseudomonas strains, the discriminating power of rpoD gene sequences was also reported in previous studies on the taxonomy of the genus Pseudomonas (the Pseudomonasstutzeri genomovars and Pseudomonascorrugata groups) (Guasp et al. 2000; Cladera et al. 2004; Mulet et al. 2008).\n\nIn this study, a comparison between the 16S rRNA, Pseudomonas-specific and rpoD genes is performed in order to evaluate the use of an alternative gene as a marker for molecular microbial ecology. We finally address whether the rpoD gene fulfills the criteria required for a molecular marker in microbial ecology. Protein-encoding genes have been reported to evolve much faster than rRNAs (Ochman and Wilson 1987); thus a phylogenetic analysis using the rpoD sequences was expected to provide higher resolution than one using 16S rRNA sequences.\n\nMaterials and methods\nIsolation of fluorescent pseudomonads and genomic DNA\nIn all, 22 pseudomonad isolates were recovered from soil samples; grasslands of Pithoragarh (latitude—29°35′N and longitude—80°15′N, altitude—1615 masl) and forests of Almora (latitude—29°37′N and longitude 79°40′E, altitude—1250 masl); central Himalayan region in Uttarakhand using King’s B and Gould’s medium (data not shown). All these isolates were screened for their antagonistic potential (Gould et al. 1984). The genomic DNA was extracted by a modified method of Bazzicalupo and Fani (1995).\n\nPCR amplification of target genes of 16S rDNA, Pseudomonas-specific gene region and rpoD gene region\nGenomic DNA was amplified by using three different PCR primer sets—one set was of universal primers (Anzai et al. 2000), other one was of Pseudomonas-specific PCR (Ps-PCR) primers (Widmer et al. 1998) and third one was for housekeeping gene rpoD-specific primers (Mulet et al. 2009).\n\nThe universal primer set included forward primer GM3f (5′ AGAGTTTGATCMTGGC 3′) and reverse primer GM4r (5′ TACCTTGTTACGACTT 3′) for the amplification of 1492 bp region of the 16S rDNA gene. A 50 μl of reaction mixture included, 5 μl (5–10 ng) of bacterial DNA as template, 5 μl of 10× buffer for Taq DNA polymerase (100 mM of Tris–HCl and 15 mM MgCl2), 1 μl of MgCl2 (25 mM), so that the final concentration of Mg2+ is 2 mM, 0.25 μM of each primer, 400 μM of each dNTPs and one unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Bangalore Genei, India). The reaction condition includes an initial denaturation of 7 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C and 1 min at 72 °C with the final extension of 5 min at 72 °C.\n\nPs-PCR primer set included forward primer, Ps-for (5′ GGTCTGAGAGGATGATCAGT 3′) and the reverse primer, Ps-rev (5′ TTAGCTCCACCTCGCGGC 3′) for amplification of 990 bp Pseudomonas-specific gene region. rpoD primer set contains primers PsEG30F 5′ ATYGAAATCGCCAARCG 3′ and PsEG790R 5′ CGGTTGATKTCCTTGA 3′ used for the amplification of 736 bp region. For amplification of both of these primer sets, a 50 μl of reaction mixture included, 5 μl (5–10 ng) of bacterial DNA as template, 5 μl of 10× buffer for Taq DNA polymerase (100 mM of Tris–HCl and 15 mM MgCl2), 2.5 μM of each primer, 250 μM of dNTPs and one unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Bangalore Genei, India). The reaction condition for Ps-PCR amplification includes an initial denaturation of 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 57 °C and 1 min at 72 °C with the final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. The reaction condition for rpoD gene region primer includes an initial denaturation of 7 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 5 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C and 1.5 min at 72 °C with the final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. The amplification was carried out on Gen Amp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Amplified DNA was electrophoresed in 1 % agarose gel at 80 mA for 1 h and visualized under UV gel documentation system Gel Doc Mega (BIOSYSTEMATICA).\n\nPolymorphism in 16S rDNA, Pseudomonas-specific and rpoD gene region\nRestriction digestion of complete 16S rDNA region (1492 bp), Pseudomonas-specific gene region (990 bp) and rpoD gene region (760 bp) amplicons were set in 25 μl reaction mixture containing 20 μl aliquot of an amplicon of all the PCR reactions from both the primers as template, 1× enzyme buffer and 1 U/rxn of each tetra cutting restriction enzymes AluI, RsaI and BamHI. All the three PCR amplicons were digested with AluI, RsaI and BamHI at 37 °C for 2 h. Enzymes were inactivated by mixing the loading dye and kept at −20 °C. The products were analyzed by agarose gel (2.5 %) electrophoresis carried out at 80 V for 2/3 run of gel.\n\nPhylogenetic relationships of pseudomonad isolates\nDNA bands generated by digestion of amplified 16S rDNA, Pseudomonas-specific gene and rpoD with the three restriction enzymes AluI, RsaI and BamHI were used to construct a UPGMA dendrogram using NTSYSpc version 2.0 software calculating euclidean similarity coefficient. Bands were scored for their presence (1) and absence (0), ignoring their intensities.\n\nIdentification of fluorescent pseudomonads (FLPs) and sequence analysis\nThe amplified 16S rRNA gene region, Pseudomonas-specific gene region and rpoD gene region of the selected antagonistic isolates were amplified with same primers and procedure as mentioned above and sequenced directly on 3730 DNA sequencer by ABI big dye terminator technology (Central Instrumental Facility, Biotech Centre, UDSC, Delhi University, South Campus, New Delhi). The acquired sequences were aligned and their consensus sequences were computed with the DNAMAN analysis system (Lynnon Biosoft, Quebec, Canada). Then these consensus sequences were compared with those extracted from GenBank using BLASTN program and aligned using CLUSTAL W program using MEGA 5 software.\n\nResults\nGenetic profiling\nAll the 22 antagonistic FLPs were genetically characterized using three genes; 16S rRNA, Pseudomonas-specific and rpoD; and phylogeny was determined. All the fluorescent Pseudomonas species reported till date are genetically placed into eight groups namely Pseudomonasaeruginosa,P.fluorescens,P.chlororaphis,P.stutzeri,P.syringae,P.putida,P.pertucinogena and P.putida (Palleroni et al. 1972; Palleroni 1992).\n\nComparing 16S rDNA, Pseudomonas-specific and rpoD gene as phylogenetic markers\nAn alternative marker to the 16S rRNA for molecular microbial ecology studies is the single-copy gene encoding the RNA polymerase σ subunit, rpoD. This study compares the 16S rRNA, Pseudomonas-specific and rpoD genes from 22 fluorescent pseudomonads genomes.\n\nThe phylogenetic trees obtained from 16SrRNA and Pseudomonas-specific genes were almost similar. Cluster I and II delineated in both the dendrogram (Figs. 1, 2), but their relationships within subclusters were modified. Isolate AS9 which was the sole representative of SCII of CI in 16S rDNA-based dendrogram was now placed in SCI of CI along with AS1 and AS2 in dendrogram obtained by Pseudomonas-specific gene region. Also isolates AS16, AS20, AS21 and AS22 presented in SCI shifted to SCIII in Pseudomonas-specific gene region-based dendrogram. Isolates AS5, AS6 and AS7 presented as SCIII in 16S rDNA-based dendrogram were now placed in a new position as SCII. Similarly, isolates AS8, AS17, AS19 and AS10, AS11, AS14, AS18 were representing two subclusters SC V (AS8, AS17, AS19) and SC VI (AS10, AS11, AS14, AS18) in Pseudomonas-specific gene region-based dendrogram while these were arranged within three subclusters in 16S rDNA-based dendrogram SC V (AS10 and AS14), SC VI (AS8, AS17 and AS19) and SC VII (AS11 and AS18).Fig. 1 Combined UPGMA dendrogram of 16S rDNA region of FLPs on the basis of ARDRA with AluI, RsaI and BamHI\n\nFig. 2 Combined UPGMA dendrogram of Pseudomonas-specific gene region of FLPs on the basis of ARDRA with AluI, RsaI and BamHI\n\n\n\nThe relationships of isolates in a dendrogram based on polymorphism in rpoD region were different than those obtained with ARDRA and polymorphism in 16S rRNA and Pseudomonas-specific region (Fig. 3). In rpoD dendrogram, relationships among the FLPs were more refined, there was less euclidean difference among them. All the 22 FLPs were present in two clusters and these two clusters were bifurcated at 0.76 distance on euclidean scale in rpoD-based phylogenetic analysis while 16S rDNA-based dendrogram was bifurcated at 0.67 distance and Pseudomonas-specific gene region-based dendrogram was bifurcated at 0.71 distance on euclidean scale. From this result it was concluded that Pseudomonas-specific gene was more evolved tool for species identification than 16S rDNA while rpoD, a housekeeping gene, was best for species identification out of these three chronometers.Fig. 3 Combined UPGMA dendrogram of rpoD gene region of FLPs on the basis of RFLP pattern with AluI, RsaI and BamHI\n\n\n\nConstruction of the phylogenetic structures deduced from nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA, Pseudomonas-specific and rpoD genes\nThe nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA, Pseudomonas-specific and rpoD genes from three fluorescent pseudomonads were determined, and phylogenetic trees based on these data showing evolutionary relatedness of the isolates along with known Pseudomonas species were constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method. Recent approaches used for bacterial characterization include polyphasic system of identification. Three isolates AS5, AS7 and AS15 were selected for further sequencing on the basis of biocontrol traits (data not shown). BLAST analysis of 16S rDNA, Pseudomonas-specific gene and rpoD gene sequences of biocontrol isolates AS5, AS7 and AS15 showed 99–100 % homology with species of Pseudomonas. Gene sequences submitted to GenBank were provided with the accession numbers (Table 1). The sequences of isolates AS5, AS7 and AS15 obtained were compared with those from GenBank using BLASTN (Altschul et al. 1990) and EzTaxon (Kim et al. 2012). For phylogenetic analysis, sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W software (Thompson et al. 1997). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei 1987) by the software MEGA5.Table 1 GenBank accession numbers of the isolates\n\nCode\tName\tAccession number\t\nAS5 (16S rDNA region)\t\nPseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS5\tKM538944\t\nAS7 (16S rDNA region)\t\nPseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS7\tKM538946\t\nAS15 (16S rDNA region)\t\nPseudomonas fluorescens strain AS15\tKM538945\t\nAS5 (Pseudomonas-specific gene region)\t\nPseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS5\tKM538947\t\nAS7 (Pseudomonas-specific gene region)\t\nPseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS7\tKM538949\t\nAS15 (Pseudomonas-specific gene region)\t\nPseudomonas fluorescens strain AS15\tKM538948\t\nAS5 (rpoD gene region)\t\nPseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS5\tKM593260\t\nAS7 (rpoD gene region)\t\nPseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS7\tKM593262\t\nAS15 (rpoD gene region)\t\nPseudomonas fluorescens strain AS15\tKM593261\t\n\n\nThe topology of 16S rRNA and Pseudomonas-specific gene-based trees was comparable. Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences (Fig. 4) of isolates AS5, AS7 and AS15 against the type strains of Pseudomonas species recorded in BLASTN database showed the affiliation of strains to fluorescent groups: Pseudomonasaeruginosa group and Pseudomonasfluorescens group, respectively. In this tree, the three fluorescent pseudomonads were grouped into a single cluster, which includes P.plecoglossicida,P.lundensis and P.oleovorans strains along with the P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens strains. The closest relatives of P.fluorescens AS15 were P.aeruginosa. The next closest relatives are P.plecoglossicida,P.Lundensis and P.Oleovorans. The closest relatives to P.aeruginosa AS5 and AS7 were P.fluorescens strains. According to the neighbor joining phylogenetic tree, strains AS5, AS7 and AS15 were clustered in a separate branch most closely related to P.plecoglossicida. Strains of P.fluorescens and P.aeruginosa though present in a separate branch yet not grouped within defined clusters.Fig. 4 Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (1492 nt) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS5 KM538944, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS15 KM538946 and Pseudomonas fluorescens strain AS15 KM538945 and the type strains of closely related species of the genus Pseudomonas.

This gene region was from V2 to V8 variable region of 16S rRNA gene and conserved within genus Pseudomonas. As expected the phylogenetic positions of AS5, AS7 and AS15 were similar with that obtained using 16S rRNA gene. In this phylogenetic tree, all the three strains were placed in a separate branch and their closest relative was P.frederiksbergensis. This concluded that phylogenetic positioning of the isolates within genus Pseudomonas with Pseudomonas-specific gene and 16S rRNA gene was almost similar. Pseudomonas-specific gene defines the phylogenetic position of P.fluorescens and P.aeruginosa strains better than 16S rRNA as isolates of both species were grouped into defined clusters.Fig. 5 Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on Pseudomonas-specific gene sequences (990 nt) Pseudomonas\naeruginosa strain AS5 KM538947, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS15 KM538949 and Pseudomonas fluorescens strain AS15 KM538948 and the type strains of closely related species of the genus Pseudomonas. Bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1000 replications) are shown at branch points. Bar 2 nt substitutions per 100 nt\n\n\n\nThe topology of the tree reconstructed from the rpoD gene sequences was different from those obtained from 16S rRNA and Pseudomonas-specific gene (Tayeb et al. 2005; Mulet et al. 2009, 2010, 2012; Ramos et al. 2013; Toro et al. 2013). When the whole rpoD sequences from the three tested strains were used for the analysis, these were arranged into two major clusters. The rpoD gene phylogenetic tree showed that strains AS5 and AS7 (P.aeruginosa) were clustered in a separate branch from other strains of genus Pseudomonas. Strain AS15 (P.fluorescens) earlier grouped in a same branch with P.aeruginosa (in 16S rRNA and Pseudomonas-specific gene phylogenies), was now placed in a separate branch. Now the closest relatives of AS15 were P.brenneri and P.gessardii. In this phylogenetic tree P.fluorescens and P.aeruginosa isolates were placed separately into two different branches (Fig. 6).Fig. 6 Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on rpoD gene sequences (736 nt) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS5 KM593260, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain AS15 KM593262 and Pseudomonas fluorescens strain AS15 KM593261 and the type strains of closely related species of the genus Pseudomonas. Bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1000 replications) are shown at branch points. Bar 2 nt substitutions per 100 nt\n\n\n\nThese topological differences between the 16S rRNA, Pseudomonas-specific and rpoD-based trees were also observed when the trees were reconstructed by using the unweighted pair group method with averages (UPGMA).\n\nDiscussion\nSince all the known FLPs are placed in eight groups (Anzai et al. 2000; Ramette et al. 2011), newly isolated FLPs should be characterized morphologically, biochemically and molecularly to assign it a species epithet. Phylogenetic relationships of pseudomonads resolved by using rpoD sequences were eminently different from those resolved by using 16S rRNA and Pseudomonas-specific sequences (Moore et al. 1996; Verhille Baïda et al. 1999). These discrepancies appear to have their origins in the eccentric evolutionary process of 16S rRNA genes. The secondary structures of 16S rRNA determined by the complementary sequences in the small helices are functionally important since 16S rRNA provides a scaffold for the assembly of ribosomal proteins into the small subunit and interacts with mRNA. The majority of base substitutions in 16S rRNAs between closely related organisms are located in these helices, called variable regions, and generally these substitutions are compensatory, i.e., they maintain the base pairing within the helices (Rousset et al. 1989; Dixon and Hillis 1993). Yamamoto et al. (2000) observed that the genetic distances in the variable regions of 16S rRNAs correlated poorly with the synonymous distances in the rpoD genes. This observation suggests that the base substitutions in these helices might not be accumulated by successive point mutations, but might be caused by single-event mutations introducing multiple substitutions. Thus, the genetic distances calculated from the whole 16S rRNA sequences could be erroneous because the numbers of base substitutions outside the variable regions are much fewer. Because of the high ratios of evolution in the rpoD nucleotide sequences, it was very easy to design PCR primers or probes having specificity for clusters of species, subspecies or higher classes. On the other hand, the design of such primers or probes based on the variable regions of 16S rRNA presents a problem, because sequence similarity among the variable regions does not always guarantee a close phylogenetic relationship (Yamamoto et al. 2000). In conclusion, classification, identification and detection systems for pseudomonads based on rpoD sequences can be very useful in microbial ecology and other fields of bacteriology.\n\nComparing 16S rRNA, Pseudomonas-specific and rpoD genes as phylogenetic markers\nThe basic topologies of 16S rRNA and Pseudomonas-specific NJ trees were similar to each other, but slightly different from rpoD-based NJ tree. The most conspicuous difference between them was the branching order of the clusters that included the ‘P. aeruginosa lineage’ strains and those that included the ‘P. fluorescens lineage’ strains. In the 16S rRNA and Pseudomonas-specific NJ trees, both of these lineages were branched off as a single cluster after they had diverged from the remaining mass of Pseudomonas, whilst in the rpoD NJ tree, the ‘P. aeruginosa lineage’ cluster branched off first, followed by the ‘P. fluorescens lineage’, which diverged from the rest.\n\nThe above results were proved in a study conducted by Case et al. (2006), where phylogenetic resolution by these two genes (16S rRNA and rpoD) among 13 data sets showed that the rpoD gene provided more phylogenetic resolution than the 16S rRNA gene in seven cases, equal resolution in four cases, and lower resolution in two cases. This concluded that housekeeping genes are better evolutionary chronometer for studying evolutionary relationships among the organisms. Mulet et al. (2009) concluded that the primers designed for rpoD gene region are sufficiently selective for detection of Pseudomonas because it has only a few degenerations, precisely two for the forward and one for the reverse primer.\n\nEstablishing rpoD as an alternative gene marker for microbial ecology\nProtein-encoding genes, such as rpoD, have several advantages over RNA-encoding genes as molecular markers. They can be used at both the amino acid and nucleotide levels for phylogenetic analysis. Protein alignments allow for resolution of relationships at higher taxonomic levels (domain or phylum) when one or more codon positions are saturated. Nucleotide-level alignments allow for fine-scale resolution, with synonymous first and third codon positions allowing for nearly neutral mutations which can be detected between very closely related organisms (species level or lower). This is likely the reason why rpoD performed better than the 16S rRNA gene in resolving relationships at the subspecies level. The resolution provided by rpoD can also be increased further by sequencing other protein-encoding genes and examining allelic profiles of different isolates rather than using single gene sequence comparisons (Thompson et al. 1997). Our analyses \nalso demonstrate that rpoD displays other important characteristics as an ecological marker, including (a) its universal presence in all prokaryotes; (b) the presence of slowly and quickly evolving regions for the design of probes and primers of differing specificities; (c) having a housekeeping function, making it less susceptible to some forms of lateral gene transfer; and (d) a large enough size to contain phylogenetic information even after removal of regions which are difficult to align. It means that the size of rpoD gene is 760 bp which is sufficient to carry the information that will differentiate among the species, i.e., neither the sequence size is too short to carry any useful information nor it too long to have less variable and more conserved sequences which will hinder in differentiation among Pseudomonas species.\n\nThe use of a single-copy gene for intra-genus species identification is an important milestone in microbial ecology, as it could allow for the accurate measurement of diversity and phylogenetic relationships. rpoD provided comparable phylogenetic resolution to that of the 16S rRNA gene at all taxonomic levels, except between closely related organisms (species and subspecies levels), for which it provided better resolution (Case et al. 2006). This is particularly relevant in the context of a growing number of studies focusing on subspecies diversity, in which single-copy protein-encoding genes such as rpoB could complement the information provided by the 16S rRNA gene.\n\nThis work was financially supported by AICRP-PHT from ICAR, Government of India.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nNone.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAltschul SF  Gish W  Miller W  Myers EW  Lipman DJ   Basic local alignment search tool J Mol Biol 1990 215 403 410 10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80360-2 2231712 \nAnzai Y  Kim H  Park J  Wakabayashi H  Oyaizu H   Phylogenetic affiliation of the pseudomonads based on 16S rRNA sequence Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 2000 50 1563 1589 10.1099/00207713-50-4-1563 10939664 \nBazzicalupo M  Fani R   Clapp JP   The use of RAPD for generating specific DNA probes for microorganisms Methods in molecular biology 1995 Totowa Humana 155 175 \nCase RJ  Boucher Y  Dahllof I  Holmstrom C  Doolittle WF  Kjelleberg S   Use of 16S rRNA and rpo B genes as molecular markers for microbial ecology studies Appl Environ Microbiol 2006 73 1 278 288 10.1128/AEM.01177-06 17071787 \nCladera AM  Bennasar A  Barcelo M  Lalucat J  Garcia-Valdes E   Comparative genetic diversity of Pseudomonas stutzeri  genomovars, clonal structure, and phylogeny of the species J Bacteriol 2004 186 5239 5248 10.1128/JB.186.16.5239-5248.2004 15292125 \nCrosby LD  Criddle CS   Understanding bias in microbial community analysis techniques due to rrn  operon copy number heterogeneity Biotechniques 2003 34 790 794 12703304 \nDahllof I  Baillie H  Kjelleberg S   rpo B-based microbial community analysis avoids limitations inherent in 16S rRNA gene intraspecies heterogeneity Appl Environ Microbiol 2000 66 3376 3380 10.1128/AEM.66.8.3376-3380.2000 10919794 \nDixon MT  Hillis DM   Ribosomal RNA secondary structure: compensatory mutations and implications for phylogenetic analysis Mol Bid Evol 1993 10 1 256 267 \nGiovannoni SJ  Britschgi TB  Moyer CL  Field KG   Genetic diversity in Sargasso Sea bacterioplankton Nature 1990 3 60 63 10.1038/345060a0 2330053 \nGould WD  Hagedorn C  Bardinelli TR  Zablotowicz RM   New selective media for enumeration and recovery of fluorescent pseudomonads from various habitats Appl Environ Microbiol 1984 49 28 32 16346705 \nGuasp C  Moore ERB  Lalucat J  Bennasar A   Utility of internally-transcribed 16S–23S rDNA spacer regions for the definition of Pseudomonas stutzeri  genomovars and other Pseudomonas  species Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 2000 50 1629 1639 10.1099/00207713-50-4-1629 10939670 \nKim YK  Lee SC  Cho YY  Oh HJ  Ko YH   Isolation of Cellulolytic Bacillus subtilis  strains from agricultural environments ISRN Microbiol 2012 20 139 152 \nMoore R, Dowding J, Bratt H, Gawron JM, Gorfu Y, Cheyer A (1996) Commandtalk: a spoken-language interface for battlefield simulation.

But the enzymes that possess a significant role in the breakdown of biomass remain relatively unexplored. Thermophilic microorganisms are of special interest as a source of novel thermostable enzymes. Many thermophilic microorganisms possess properties suitable for biotechnological and commercial use. There is, indeed, a considerable demand for a new generation of stable enzymes that are able to withstand severe conditions in industrial processes by replacing or supplementing traditional chemical processes. This manuscript reviews the pertinent role of thermophilic microorganisms as a source for production of thermostable enzymes, factors afftecting them, recent patents on thermophiles and moreso their wide spectrum applications for commercial and biotechnological use.\n\nKeywords\nThermophilic microorganismsThermostable enzymesHeat tolerance and biomassissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nOrganisms with an optimum temperature for growth between 60 and 80 °C are generally designated as thermophiles, while those growing optimally above 80 °C are referred to as hyperthermophiles (Santos and Da Costa 2002). Thermophilic bacteria are microbes that mostly inhabit hot springs, live and survive in temperatures above 70 °C. As a consequence of growth at high temperatures and unique macromolecular properties, thermophiles can possess high metabolism, physically and chemically stable enzymes and lower growth but higher end product yields than similar mesophilic species (Haki and Rakshit 2003) (Tables 1, 2).Table 1 Thermophilic enzymes and their potential roles\n\nMicroorganisms\tEnzymes\tTemperature of activity\tApplications\tReferences\t\n\nPyrococcus woesei\n\talpha-Amylases\tTopt. = 100 °C\tSugar industry and starch processing\tAlqueres et al.

(1996)\t\n\n\nNatural environments for anaerobic thermophiles range from terrestrial volcanic sites (including solfatara fields) with temperatures slightly above ambient temperature, to submarine hydrothermal systems (sediments, submarine volcanoes, fumaroles and vents) with temperatures exceeding 300 °C, subterranean sites such as oil reservoirs, and solar heated surface soils with temperatures up to 65 °C. There are also human-made hot environments such as compost piles (usually around 60–70 °C but as high as 100 °C) slag heaps, industrial processes and water heaters (Oshima and Moriya 2008).\n\nThe ubiquitous nature of the thermophiles is attested to by the great variety of sources from which they have been isolated from freshly fallen snow (Golikowa 1926) to the sands of the Sahara Desert (Negre 1913). They have been found to occur in the air (Sames 1900), the soil of temperate (Blau 1906; Gilbert 1904; Sames 1900) and tropical (De Kruyff, 1910) regions, salt (MacFadyen and Blaxall 1896) and fresh water, both cold (Tirelli 1907; Catterina 1904) and thermal (Georgevitch 1910a, b; Falcioni 1907; Benignetm 1905; Setchell 1903).\n\nFactors affecting heat tolerance of thermophilic organisms are as follows:Permeability: cell membranes effectively function as a permeability barrier, controlling the in-flow and out-flow of low-molecular weight compounds. The permeability of fatty acyl ester lipid membranes is highly temperature dependent and their phase-transition temperature is dependent on the fatty acid composition, so when the growth temperature shifts, the fatty acid composition of membrane lipids is quickly regulated (Koga 2012).\n\nChemical stability: thermophilic organisms are able to grow at high temperature due to the chemical stability of their membrane lipids (Koga 2012).\n\nTemperature: lipids that increase in proportion to an increase in growth temperature may be designated as “thermophilic lipids.” In the extremely thermophilic environment, methanoarchaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii have been reported. When the growth temperature increases from 45 to 65 °C, the diether lipids (archaeolbased lipids) decrease from 80 to 20 %, while the standard caldarchaeol-based and cyclic archaeol-based lipids increase from 10 to 40 %, respectively (Sprott et al. 1991).\n\nG+C content: rRNA and tRNA molecules of thermophilic bacteria have higher G+C contents than mesophiles (Galtier and Lobry 1997). Because the GC base pair forms more hydrogen bonds than the AT base pair, higher G+C contents in the double-stranded stem region improves thermostability of the RNA molecules (Lao and Forsdyke 2000; Paz et al. 2004).\n\nProteins: the surface regions of thermophilic proteins have fewer (non-charged) polar amino acids and more charged amino acids, and these charged residues result in an increased number of intramolecular salt bridges (Thompson and Eisenberg 1999).\n\n\n\nThe ability of microorganisms to survive under harsh conditions has prompted researchers to study these organisms to better understand their characteristics and eventually utilize them in various applications. Further insight into thermophilic microorganisms has been highlighted through this review article as thermophiles possess enumerable properties suitable for biotechnological and commercial applications.\n\nBiotechnological applications of thermophiles\nThermophiles have shown tremendous promise in terms of their applications in modern biotechnology. Some of the high end applications of these thermophiles have been elucidated below (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Various applications of thermophilic microorganisms\n\n\n\nBioconversion of lignocellulose to hydrogen\nAlthough many reported microorganisms possess the capability of cellulose hydrolysis or hydrogen production (H2), no conclusive research has been able to clarify that both of these capabilities are possessed in a single microorganism. Hot springs are a potential source for thermophilic hydrogen (H2) and ethanol producing micro-organisms. Compared with mesophiles, thermophiles are thought to be more robust for cellulose degradation and hydrogen production. In particular, the rate of cellulolysis is presumably more rapid at elevated temperatures (Wiegel and Ljungdahl 1986; Blumer-Schuette et al. 2008). As a result, thermophilic microorganisms isolated from various environments are an attractive prospect for cellulolytic biohydrogen production (CBP) from complex lignocellulosic biomass. The co-cultures of thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum with non-cellulolytic thermophilic anaerobic bacteria and the extremely thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus have been used for CBP-based hydrogen production (Liu et al. 2008; Ivanova et al. 2009). Several species of genus Thermoanaerobacterium including T. thermosaccharolyticum, T. polysaccharolyticum, T. zeae, T. lactoethylicum, T. aotearoense, and T. saccharolyticum possess the capability to utilize various macromolecules accompanied by H2 production (Ganghofer et al. 1998; Hoster et al. 2001; O-Thong et al. 2008; Ren et al. 2008; Cann et al. 2001; Ueno et al. 2001).\n\nSeveral anaerobic thermophiles have been shown to utilize cellulose, including Clostridium thermocellum, Clostridiumstraminisolvens, Clostridium stercorarium, Caldicellulosiruptorsaccharolyticus, and Caldicellulosiruptor obsidiansis (Freier et al. 1988; Hamilton-Brehm et al. 2010; Kato et al. 2004; Madden 1983; Rainey et al. 1994; Wiegel and Dykstra 1984).\n\nHydrogen may be the fuel of the future once hydrogen fuel cells for propelling cars are perfected (McAlister 1998). When oxygen and hydrogen are combined in a fuel cell, they provide electricity and a little heat, giving water as the only waste product. The hydrogen car will be clean because it will not discharge nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide. Hydrogen can be obtained cheaply using special enzymes (extremozymes) by the transformation of cellulose into glucose sugar, then converting the glucose product and its byproduct, gluconic acid into hydrogen (Woodward et al. 2000).\n\nThe extremely thermophilic bacterium C. owensensis has comprehensive hemicellulase and cellulase system. The enzymes of C. owensensis had high ability for degrading the hemicellulose of native lignocellulosic biomass. High temperature pre-hydrolysis on native lignocellulosic biomass by the extra-enzyme of C. owensensis could greatly improve the glucan conversion rate, making almost the same contribution as steam-exploded pretreatment (Peng et al. 2015).\n\nConversion of glycerol to lactate\nBioprospecting efforts for exploring novel biocatalytic molecules with unique properties have inspired the design and construction of a wider variety of artificial metabolic pathways (Bond-Watts et al. 2011). Employment of enzymes derived from thermophiles and hyperthermophiles enables the simple preparation of catalytic modules with excellent selectivity and thermal stability (Ye et al. 2012; Ninh et al. 2015). These excellent stabilities of thermophilic enzymes allow greater flexibility in the operational conditions of in vitro bioconversion systems. Generally, 10 kg of crude glycerol, which is the primary byproduct of the biodiesel industry, is released for every 100 kg of biodiesel and the growing production of biodiesel has resulted in a worldwide surplus of crude glycerol (Nguyen et al. 2013). An artificial in vitro metabolic pathway for the conversion of glycerol to lactate has been constructed. The in vitro pathway consisted of nine thermophilic and hyperthermophilic enzymes and designed to balance the intrapathway consumption and regeneration of cofactors (Okano et al. 2010).\n\nConversion of d-xylose into ethanol\nThermophilic anaerobic bacteria could be promising candidates for conversion of hemicellulose or its monomers (xylose, arabinose, mannose and galactose) into ethanol with a satisfactory yield and productivity. A number of thermophilic enrichment cultures, and new isolates of thermophilic anaerobic bacterial strains growing optimally at 70–80 °C for their ethanol production from d-xylose have been isolated from hot springs, paper pulp mills and brewery waste water. The species investigated so far are Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus (Wiegel and Ljungdahl 1981; Kannan and Mutharasan 1985), Clostridium thermocellum (Viljoen et al. 1926; McBee 1954; Ng et al. 1981), Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum (Cook and Morgan 1994; Wiegel et al. 1979; Do¨nmez and O¨zcelik 1992) (reclassified as Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus) (Lee et al. 1993), Thermoanaerobium brockii (Zeikus et al. 1979; Ben-Bassat et al. 1981) (reclassified as Thermoanaerobacter brockii) (Lee et al. 1993), Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum (McClung 1935; Mistry and Cooney 1989) (reclassified as Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum) (Collins et al. 1994) and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum B6A (Lee et al. 1993; Weimer 1985). To obtain a viable bio-ethanol production, all the carbohydrate constituents of lignocellulosic biomass need to be converted into ethanol (Wright 1988; Lynd 1990; Von Sivers and Zacchi 1995). Xylan is mainly composed of D-xylose and it has been reported that most of the isolates produced ethanol as the main end fermentation product from both xylose and xylan (Sommer et al. 2004). Among the advantages, thermophiles have broad substrate spectra and can degrade both hexoses and pentoses simultaneously; some thermophiles natively degrade complex carbohydrates; they operate at temperatures that minimize contamination risk of mesophiles. Additionally, recent advances have improved ethanol yields by using genetic engineering, often by knocking out metabolic pathways to other end products.This has minimized the perceived advantage of mesophiles over thermophiles considerably, although no large scale bioethanol plants with genetically modified microbes are currently operating (Scully and Orlygsson 2015).\n\nBiodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons\nThermophiles have also been utilized for the microbial degradation of crude oil and refined petroleum pollutants. Foght and McFarlane (1999) studied the growth of extremophiles on petroleum hydrocarbon. Some potential applications are related to molecular genetics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation by bacteria. Also the factors that control degradation and methods to enhance the ability of bacteria to degrade such pollutants in the environment have been studied. April et al. (2000) studied the process of crude oil degradation by mixed populations, pure cultures, and genetic mutants. They demonstrated the loss of parent compounds and analyzed the products of bacterial attack on crude oils using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry. The use of thermophiles for biodegradation of hydrocarbons with low water solubility is of interest, as solubility and bioavailability, are enhanced at elevated temperatures. Thermophiles, predominantly bacilli, possess a significant potential for the degradation of environmental pollutants, including all major classes. Indigenous thermophilic hydrocarbon degraders are of special significance for the bioremediation of oil-polluted desert soil (Margesin and Schinner 2001).\n\nRecovery of heavy metals\nAs a result of increasing industrial activities, heavy metal contamination is a problem. Microorganisms can interact with heavy metals in a variety of ways that result in decreased metal mobility and solubility. The metal and sulfate-reducing bacteria have suitable physiology for metal precipitation and immobilization. The activities of these microbes provide metabolic products such as iron and hydrogen sulphide, which lead to mineral formation. These minerals can react with heavy metals, resulting in precipitation and hence detoxification (Chalaal and Islam 2001). In order to understand the removal of such types of toxins, Chalaal and Islam (2001) used two strains of thermophilic bacteria belonging to the Bacillus family, isolated from hot water stream, to remove strontium from aqueous stream systems. These bacteria were able to concentrate strontium in one side of a two-compartment bioreactor. Immobilization of heavy metals using sulphide-producing microorganisms has been reported as an effective means of treating some metal-contaminated sites (Crawford and Crawford 1996).\n\nRemediation of textile dyes\nLaccase enzyme purified from thermophile, Geobacillus thermocatenulatus MS5 is of very higher catalytic activity and are economic, highly stable at different temperatures and pH levels and can be used widely and effectively in the removal of the dyes that cause environmental pollution. Verma and Shirkot investigated the purified laccase enzyme for the removal of some dyes used in industry i.e., Remazole Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), Indigo carmine, Congo red, Brilliant green and Bromophenol blue. In case of Indigo carmine and congo red dye, 99 % of decolorization occured after 48 h of incubation, followed by RBBR dye, Bromophenol Blue and Brilliant Green i.e., 98, 70 and 60 % respectively (Verma and Shirkot 2014).\n\nThermophilic lignolytic fungal cultures were isolated from soil/digested slurry/plant debris and were subjected for acclimatization to Remazol Brilliant Blue (RBB) at 0.05 % concentration, in the malt extract broth (MEB). The results suggested the isolates as a useful tool for degradation of reactive dyes (Sahni and Gupta 2014).\n\nSaccharification of agricultural residues\nSporotricum thermophile LAR5 is an excellent fungal isolate having an ability to utilize crude agriculture based materials as carbon and nitrogen sources to produce significant cellulase titre. Cellulase possesses desirable properties from industrial application point of view such as activity and stability over broad pH range and high temperatures and good saccharification ability on acid-pretreated rice straw. It has been reported that considerable sugars are produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of acid-pretreated solids (3.5, 5.7, 7.9, 7.7 micromoles/ml from 1, 3, 5 and 7 % acid-pretreated solids, respectively) using the S. thermophile LAR5 cellulase (Bajaj et al. 2014). Recombinant S. thermophile cellulase shows potential to hydrolyze variety of cellulosic substrates with a peculiarity that presence of lignin in various substrates enhances the degree of saccharification (Dimarogona et al. 2012).\n\nThermophilic bacilli in dairy processing\nThermophilic bacilli are used as hygiene indicators of processed product, within the dairy processing context. This is because of the ability of these strains to form endospores and biofilms. The thermophilic bacilli, such as Anoxybacillus flavithermus and Geobacillus spp., are an important group of contaminants in the dairy industry. Although these bacilli are generally not pathogenic, their presence in dairy products is an indicator of poor hygiene and high numbers are unacceptable to customers. In addition, their growth may result in milk product defects caused by the production of acids or enzymes, potentially leading to off-flavors (Burgess et al. 2010). Many strains of genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, as well as some enterococci and yeasts, have been shown to possess probiotic properties with potential for prophylaxis and treatment of a range of gastrointestinal disorders (Varankovich et al. 2015).\n\nKeratin degradation\nA novel thermophilic bacterium, Fervidobacterium pennavorans, belonging to the Thermotogales order, isolated from hot springs of Azores island, grows optimally at 70 °C and pH 6.5. It is the first known thermophile that is able to degrade native feathers at high temperatures. With the help of these enzymes, feathers could be converted to defined products such as the rare amino acids, serine, cysteine and proline (Friedrich and Antranikian 1996).\n\nCancer treatment\nAsperjinone, a nor-neolignan, and Terrein, a suppressor of ABCG2-expressing breast cancer cells were isolated from thermophile Aspergillus terreus, which can restore drug sensitivity and could be the key to improve breast cancer therapeutics. Terrein, displayed strong cytotoxicity against breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Treatment with terrein significantly suppressed growth of ABCG2-expressing breast cancer cells. This suppressive effect was achieved by inducing apoptosis via activating the caspase-7 pathway and inhibiting the Akt signaling pathway, which led to a decrease in ABCG2-expressing cells and a reduction in the side-population phenotype (Liao et al. 2012). Conventional chemotherapeutic agents are usually non specific towards cancerous cells and inhibit the progression of any dividing cells. The therapeutic potential of antitumor drugs is seriously limited by the manifestation of serious side effects and drug resistance. So there is a need of agents that are more effective, more selective and may not cause drug resistance. According to Patent no. WO 2006/053445 A1, an invention is disclosed, whereby a composition of bacteriocin derived from lactic acid bacteria and a carrier can be used for inhibiting proliferation of cancerous cells (Mehta et al. 2013).\n\nConclusions\nThe increasing number of patents indicates that there is a growing interest in the commercial applications of thermophiles. The demand for thermostable enzymes has increased tremendously in the past few years. Since only a very few species from this group of microorganisms have been isolated till date, there seems to be a large number of hyperthermophilic catalysts with unique properties awaiting discovery.\n\nAuthors would like to acknowledge M.M.

It has more recently been supplanted in agricultural markets by herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate. However, the appearance of weeds resistant to these herbicides has prompted biotech companies to engineer crop plants with transgenes conferring resistance to two herbicides, not just one. This would considerably delay the formation of herbicide-resistant mutant weeds. To that effect, Dow AgroSciences has recently released transgenic soybeans and corn resistant to both the herbicides dicamba or glyphosate and 2,4-D. These crops are described in layman’s terms in their website at http://www.enlist.com/en/how-it-works/enlist-traits. It should be noted that the author of this Note is not generally opposed to GM crop plants. Rather, he is of the opinion that scientific evidence should prevail in the release or rejection of such crops (see Lurquin 2001, 2002).\n\nThe idea of engineering 2,4-D resistance in plants is not new. A scenario to achieve this goal was presented by us in February 1985 at a symposium of the Weed Science Society of America in Seattle, Washington. This scenario was subsequently published in the peer-reviewed journal Weed Science (Perkins et al. 1987). Our reasoning was based on the ability of certain soil bacteria to degrade 2,4-D all the way to succinate (Fig. 1), a useful compound member of the Krebs cycle. To that effect we proposed to clone and transfer to plants one or more tfd genes from the soil bacterium known at the time as Alcaligenes eutrophus. This bacterial species is now known as Cupriavidus necator. Plasmid pJP4 harbored by C. necator 134 carries six genes designated tfdA–F that code for the degradative pathway of 2,4-D (Don and Pemberton 1985). The first gene of the pathway, tfdA, codes for an oxygenase that converts 2,4-D into 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) (Fig. 1). C. necator 134 grown in the presence of 2,4-D does indeed produce 2,4-DCP (Perkins et al. 1987). Interestingly, we first demonstrated that 2,4-DCP is much less toxic to plants than 2,4-D (Perkins et al. 1987). This observation was confirmed by others years later (Taylor et al. 1989). Thus, we reasoned that plants engineered with C. necator’s tfdA gene would convert phytotoxic 2,4-D into much less phytotoxic 2,4-DCP, hence rendering these plants resistant to the herbicide. This was indeed shown to be the case (Streber and Willmitzer 1989; Lyon et al. 1989; Bayley et al. 1992). Dow Agrosciences’ recently released 2,4-D resistant transgenic corn and soybeans were engineered with C. necator’stfdA homologs isolated from Sphingobium herbicidivorans and Delftia acidovorans and thus produce 2,4-DCP (Wright et al. 2010).Fig. 1 Partial catabolism of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) by the two enzymes coded for by tfdA and tfdB. 2,4-DCP 2,4-dichlorophenol; 3,5-DCC 3,5-dichlorocatechol. TfdA (the product of the tfdA gene) converts phytotoxic 2,4-D into much less phytotoxic 2,4-DCP (Perkins et al. 1987). The latter is toxic to a variety of animal cells, however (see text). TfdB converts 2,4-DCP into 3,5-DCC, a compound that still displays phytotoxicity (Liao et al. 2006). Tobacco plants transgenic for tfdB exist (Perkins et al. 1990a, b) but have not been used in phytotoxicity studies. Human toxicity of 3,5-DCC is present but information is scant. According to its Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) 3,5-DCC can cause eye, skin and respiratory irritation. The remaining phytotoxicity of 3,5-DCC can be reduced by inserting the third gene of the pathway, tfdC (Liao et al. 2006). TfdC converts 3,5-DCC into dichloro cis, cis-muconate by opening the aromatic ring (not shown). The human toxicity of dichloro cis, cis-muconate is unknown. Introducing the whole 2,4-D degradation pathway into plants would allow them to convert 2,4-D into succinate and acetyl coA (Perkins et al. 1990a)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, much reduced phytotoxicity does not necessarily mean that tfdA-(or analogous) containing 2,4-D resistant crop plants are safe for consumption. Indeed, 2,4-DCP is cytotoxic to a variety of animals and animal cell lines. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a branch of the World Health Organization, has categorized 2,4-DCP as a compound belonging to group 2B, that is, “a possible carcinogen based on inadequate evidence in humans and limited evidence in experimental animals.” But in fact, the IARC in 2015 also designated 2,4-D as a group 2B compound (http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr236E.pdf). However, a meta-analysis of the literature (Goodman et al. 2015) does not support an association between 2,4-D and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, or prostate cancer, as proposed earlier by some. Such meta-analysis does not seem to exist for 2,4-DCP and cancer risk. Nevertheless, extensive reports reviewing the earlier literature up to about the year 2000 and published by the IARC (http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol71/mono71-34.pdf) and the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (http://www.meti.go.jp/english/report/downloadfiles/gED0307e.pdf) both agree that 2,4-DCP presents low acute toxicity when delivered orally in mice and rats. For example, in rats, no effect on survival is seen after 13 weeks on 2000 mg/kg/day. In mice, no mortality is observed after 13 weeks on 2600 mg/kg/day (Syracuse Research Corporation 1992; also see Gorzinski et al. 1987). In addition, both reports indicate the absence of evidence linking 2,4-DCP and tumorigenesis in experimental animals. Further, 2,4-DCP registers negative in the Ames test but scores positive in the sister chromatid exchange test in CHO cells in vitro (see the National Toxicology Program 1989). 2,4-DCP also scores positive in the aneuploidy test with Chinese hamster V79 lung cells in vitro and induces mutations in the tk gene in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells also in vitro. (see the IARC report for references to all these observations).\n\nMore recently, 2,4-DCP has been linked to a variety of negative metabolic and additional genotoxic effects. For example, 2,4-DCP injected intraperitoneally into Swiss mice at one half the LD50 (180 mg/kg) displayed chromosome aberrations in bone-marrow and spermatocyte cells. 2,4-DCP also induced sperm head abnormalities in these animals (Amer and Aly 2001). Further, 2,4-DCP induces apoptosis in L929 mouse cells (Chen et al. 2004) and grass carp primary hepatocytes (Li et al. 2013), inhibits antioxidant enzyme activities in human erythrocytes in vitro (Bukowska 2003), exhibits androgenic effects potentiated by dihydrotestosterone in human prostate cancer cells (Kim et al. 2005) and interferes with the transcription of genes involved in steroidogenesis in H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells in vitro (Ma et al. 2012). Ma et al. (2012) also observed disruption of endocrine function in zebrafish in vivo. Also, negative reproductive effects were observed in a two-generation study in 2,4-DCP-treated Wistar-Hannover rats (Aoyama et al. 2005). Another report shows that 2,4-DCP induces global DNA hypermethylation in the liver of goldfish (Zhang et al. 2014). The use of fish species in some of the studies is not surprising as 2,4-DCP is a pollutant found in industrial effluents.\n\nIn view of some of the noxious properties displayed by 2,4-DCP already known over a decade ago, serious concerns regarding the safety of 2,4-D resistant crops producing 2,4-DCP were voiced earlier (Lurquin 2001, 2002). To try to circumvent the toxicity of 2,4-DCP, we advocated the further engineering of 2,4-D resistant plants with downstream catabolic genes, such as tfdB and beyond (Lurquin 2002). To that effect, we have cloned and sequenced the tfdB and tfdC–F operons from pJP4 (Perkins et al. 1988, 1990a). For example, Fig. 1 shows that the product of tfdB converts 2,4-DCP into 3,5-dichlorocatechol (3,5-DCC) which may be less toxic than 2,4-DCP. However, even this step does not totally solve the problem of 2,4-DCP’s permanence in resistant plants. Indeed, it has been shown (Perkins et al. 1990b) that tobacco plants transgenic for C. necator’stfdB fail to convert all their fed 2,4-DCP into 3,5-DCC, possibly as a result of 2,4-DCP’s affinity for cellular structures and/or metabolization that limit access to the tfdB gene product. In fact, Laurent et al. (2007) demonstrated that non-transgenic tobacco cells in suspension culture incubated with radiolabeled 2,4-DCP form glycoside and glucoside conjugates of the latter. This, write these authors, might be problematic, as these conjugates, when consumed by animals and humans, may release 2,4-DCP in hydrolysis reactions in their digestive tracts.\n\nIn conclusion, the safety of 2,4-D resistant crop plants remains a controversy. It behooves biotech companies responsible for the release of 2,4-D resistant crops, as well as federal agencies, to fully disclose to the public the results of extensive toxicology studies with these crops. Unfortunately, Wright et al. (2010), the creators of 2,4-D resistant corn and soybeans, do not discuss the accumulation and fate of 2,4-DCP in their article and neither does Dow AgroSciences’ relevant website (http://www.enlist.com/en/how-it-works/enlist-traits).\n\nAs mentioned above, the full degradative pathway of 2,4-D has been cloned and sequenced (Perkins et al. 1990a). Thus, nothing prevents biotechnologists from transferring several tfd genes into target crop plants to make them safer for human consumption. As a first step in that direction, Liao et al. (2006) have shown that plants transgenic for tfdC can detoxify 3,5-DCC, the second metabolite in the 2,4-D degradative pathway (Fig. 1), by converting it to dichloro cis, cis muconate. They also showed that Arabidopsis thaliana plants possess tfdD and tfdE orthologs whose products are seemingly able to further catabolize cis, cis muconate. It is not known whether 2,4-D resistant GM corn and soybeans harbor such orthologs. Thus, biotech companies should take advantage of transferring several tfd genes (or analogs) into target crop plants instead of releasing potentially harmful GM crops prematurely.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe author declares no conflict of interest.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAmer SM  Aly FAE   Genotoxic effect of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and its metabolite 2,4-dichlorophenol in mouse Mutat Res 2001 494 1 12 10.1016/S1383-5718(01)00146-2 11423340 \nAoyama H  Hojo H  Takahashi KL  Shimizu N  Araki M  Harigae M  Tanaka N  Shirasaka N  Kuwaraha M  Nakashima N  Yamamoto E  Saka M  Teramoto S   A two-generation reproductive toxicity study of 2,4-dichlorophenol in rats J Toxicol Sci 2005 30 59 78 10.2131/jts.30.S59 16641544 \nBayley C  Trolinder N  Ray C  Morgan M  Quisenberry JE  Ow DW   Engineering 2,4-D  resistance into cotton Theor Appl Genet 1992 83 645 649 10.1007/BF00226910 24202683 \nBukowska B   Effects of 2,4-D  and its metabolite 2,4-dichlorophenol on antioxidant enzymes and level of glutathione in human erythrocytes Comp Biochem Physiol C: Toxicol Pharmacol 2003 135 435 441 10.1016/S1095-6433(03)00110-7 12965188 \nChen J  Jiang J  Zhang F  Yu H  Zhang J   Cytotoxic effects of environmentally relevant chlorophenols on L929 cells and their mechanisms Cell Biol Toxicol 2004 20 183 196 10.1023/B:CBTO.0000029468.89746.64 15250542 \nDon RH  Pemberton JM   Genetic and physical map of the 2,4-D  degradative plasmid pJP4 J Bacteriol 1985 161 466 468 3968031 \nGoodman JE  Loftus CT  Zu K   2,4-d ichlorophenoxyacetic acid and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, and prostate cancer: meta-analysis of the published literature Ann Epidemiol 2015 25 626 636 10.1016/j.annepidem.2015.04.002 26066538 \nGorzinski FJ  Kociba RJ  Campbell RA  Smith FA  Nolan RJ  Eisenbrandt DL   Acute pharmacokinetic and subchronic toxicological studies of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid Fund Appl Toxicol 1987 9 423 435 10.1016/0272-0590(87)90025-X \nKim HJ  Park YI  Dong MS   Effects of 2,4-D  and DCP on the DHT-induced androgenic action in human prostate cancer cells Toxicol Sci 2005 88 52 59 10.1093/toxsci/kfi287 16107550 \nLaurent F  Canlet C  Debrauwer L  Pascal-Lorber S   Metabolic fate of [(14)C]-2,4-dichlorophenol in tobacco cell suspension cultures Environ Toxicol Chem 2007 26 2299 2307 10.1897/07-036R.1 17941740 \nLi H  Zhang X  Qiu Q  An Z  Qi Y  Huang D  Zhang Y   2,4-dichlorophenol induces apoptosis in primary hepatocytes of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella ) through mitochondrial pathway Aquat Toxicol 2013 140 117 122 10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.05.015 23774520 \nLiao Y  Zhou X  Kuai B   The key role of chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase in phytoremoval and degradation of catechol by transgenic Arabidopsis  Plant Physiol 2006 142 620 628 10.1104/pp.106.085936 16935988 \nLurquin PF   The green phoenix: a history of genetically modified plants 2001 New York Columbia University Press \nLurquin PF   High tech harvest: understanding genetically modified food plants 2002 Boulder Westview Press \nLyon BR  Llewellyn DJ  Huppatz JL  Dennis ES  Peacock WF   Expression of a bacterial gene in transgenic tobacco plants confers resistance to the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid Plant Mol Biol 1989 13 533 540 10.1007/BF00027313 2491671 \nMa Y  Han J  Guo Y  Lam PK  Wu RS  Giesy JP  Zhang X  Zhou B   Disruption of endocrine function in in vitro H295R cell-based and in in vivo assay in zebrafish by 2,4-dichlorophenol Aquat Toxicol 2012 106 173 181 10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.11.006 22155427 \nNational Toxicology Program (1989) NTP toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 2,4-dichlorophenol (CAS No. 120-83-2) in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice (feed studies).

Realizing the need for development of eco-friendly and cost effective methods, the present investigation was done for the adsorptive removal of copper from aqueous solutions with Dromaius novaehollandiae eggshell and chitosan composite. By one variable at a time method, the optimum contact time was found to be 60 min with an adsorbent dosage of 8 g/L at pH 6, initial adsorbate concentration of 20 mg/L and temperature 30 °C. The equilibrium data followed Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models and pseudo second-order kinetics. The equilibrium adsorption capacity determined from Langmuir isotherm was 48.3 mg/g. From the Van’t Hoff equation, thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy (ΔH°), entropy (ΔS°) and Gibb’s free energy (ΔG°) were calculated and inferred that the process was spontaneous, irreversible and endothermic. To know the cumulative effects of operating parameters, a three level full factorial design of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied and the suggested optimum conditions were 7.90 g/L of adsorbent dosage, 20.2651 mg/L of initial adsorbate concentration and 5.9 pH. Maximum percentage of copper adsorption attained was 95.25 % (19.05 mg/L) and the residual concentration of the metal after sorption corresponded to 0.95 mg/L, which is below the permissible limits (1.3 mg/L) of copper in drinking water. The adsorbent was characterized before and after adsorption by SEM–EDS, FTIR and XRD. The FTIR analysis showed the involvement of carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino groups while XRD analysis revealed the predominantly amorphous nature of the composite post-adsorption and the peaks at 2θ angles characteristic for copper and copper oxide. The mechanisms involved in the adsorption of copper onto the adsorbent are chemisorption, complexation and ion exchange.\n\nKeywords\nAdsorptionDromaius novaehollandiae eggshells (DNES)Chitosan (CH)DNES–CH compositeFull factorial designCopperissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nImperfect industrial activities like mining, electroplating, printing, photography, etc. and non-uniform technological development are the major factors contaminating the environment with toxic substances including heavy metals. These metals pose a significant threat to the environment and the health of living organisms because of their toxicity due to accumulation in living tissues. Metal cleaning and plating baths, pulp, paper board mills, printed circuit board production, wood pulp production, fertilizer industry, etc. are releasing copper into the environment. An ultra trace amount of copper is essential for living organisms but excess is detrimental. In human beings, ailments such as stomach upset and ulcers, liver and brain damage are caused by the excess concentrations of copper (Zhu et al. 2009). According to Safe Drinking Water act, copper has a permissible limit of 1.3 mg/L in drinking water (Johnson et al. 2002). Therefore removal of excess copper from the contaminated waters is the most important environmental issue of worldwide concern since fresh water is the basic need for biotic community. Also, depletion of copper sources could be avoided by recovery.\n\nMany conventional methods have been developed for the removal of heavy metals from effluents such as sedimentation, ion exchange, filtration and membrane processes, electrochemical processes, chemical precipitation and solvent extraction. But these methods are inefficient when the concentrations of metals are low (below 100 ppm), and are also associated with certain disadvantages like high capital investment and operational costs, high sensitivity to operational conditions, significant energy consumption and production of large quantities of waste. To overcome these technical and economical barriers, development of ecofriendly, efficient and low-cost processes is of prime significance. In this aspect, adsorption is regarded as an innovative technology with the advantages of high efficiency and selectivity for adsorbing metals even when present in low concentrations, easy desorption of metals, recycling of the adsorbents and minimization of sludge generation.\n\nDuring the last decade, several studies showed that microorganisms like bacteria (Arul Manikandan et al. 2014), fungi (Huang and Lin 2015; Kan et al. 2015) and algae (Ajjabai and Chouba 2009), agricultural wastes like Sophora japonica pods powder, coconut tree sawdust, sugarcane bagasse, water melon seed hulls and coir fiber (Amer et al. 2015; Putra et al. 2014; Gulbahar and Guzel 2013; Shukla and Shukla 2013), poultry wastes like shells/feathers (Ratna Kumari and Sobha 2012), Catla catla fish scales (Venkatesa Prabhu et al. 2012) and water snail/shrimp shell wastes (Mohanasrinivasan et al. 2014) could be used for bioremediation. Several synthetic polymer composites like activated carbon/chitosan, chitosan supported on porous glass beads, magnetic carboxymethyl chitosan, crosslinked alumina chitosan, Fe3O4/chitosan/polycomposite, crosslinked chitosan acrylonitrile copolymer and n-HAP/chitosan composite (Huang et al. 2014; Shen et al. 2013; Guijuan et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012; Ramya et al. 2011; Rajiv Gandhi et al. 2011), mesoporus and ligand composites (Awual and Hasan 2015; Awual 2015; Awual et al. 2013, 2014a, b, 2015; Espergham et al. 2011; Ghaedi et al. 2009) etc. are effective in the removal of copper.\n\nIrrespective of the biosorbent material, the main governing factors in selecting a suitable adsorbent are sorption capability, abundant local availability, low cost and ecofriendly nature. In compliance with the said factors, the authors used the discarded egg shell wastes (ES) from the poultry farms of Dromaius novaehollandiae (Emu) and synthesized DNES–Chitosan (CH) composite as an adsorbent to remove copper from aqueous solutions. ES material, considered a waste, can in fact serve two important functions: one is its utilization in the adsorption of toxic metals there by cleaning up the polluted water and the other is the avoidance of its own disposal cost. The emerald green coloured emu eggshells (DNES) and the soft gel forming chitosan (2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucose-N acetylglucosamine) processed from white mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, were combined in the ratio of 5:1 to get DNES–CH composite. In the present work, uptake of copper by DNES–CH composite was investigated with respect to vital parameters like contact time, pH, adsorbent dosage, initial metal concentration and temperature. Pseudo first order, pseudo second order and intra-particle diffusion kinetic models were used to describe the process kinetics. To analyze the adsorption equilibrium, three isotherm models viz. Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin were used. Maximum sorption capability predicts the amount of the sorbent required for effective sorption and it was obtained from Langmuir isotherm. From the Van’t Hoff equation, thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy change (ΔH°), entropy change (ΔS°) and Gibb’s free energy (ΔG°) were calculated. To study the cumulative and interactive effects and optimization of copper adsorption process, full factorial design of RSM was applied with three independent variables at three levels. To know the interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)–Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier Transform Infra Red spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed.\n\nMaterials and methods\nAdsorbents\nEgg Shells of Dromaius novaehollandiae (DNES) were collected from the poultry processing facilities of Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh, India. Shells were washed several times with deionized water to remove dirt particles. The eggshells were then ground to powder, sieved using British Standard Sieves (BSS) into particle size of 53 µm (chosen from different particle sizes tested) for use as sorbent without any pretreatment. Chitosan (prepared from Agaricus bisporus) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (740179). DNES–CH composite was prepared by first dissolving CH and DNES separately in 10 and 2 % aqueous acetic acid respectively. Further eggshells were treated with 2 % NaHCO3 for neutralisation. Then the neutralized DNES solution was added to CH solution and the mixture was dropped into an alkaline coagulant solution (H2O:MeOH:NaOH = 5:4:1 w/w). The DNES–CH (5:1) composite thus obtained was washed with distilled water and stored for experimental use.\n\nAdsorbate\nStock solution was prepared by dissolving 3.798 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O in 250 mL of deionized water, diluted to 1 L in a volumetric flask with double distilled water procured from Millipore ELIX-10 unit. Test solutions were prepared by progressive dilution of stock solution of copper with double distilled water and the pH was adjusted to the desired value by using 0.1 N HNO3 or 0.1 N NaOH solutions. All chemicals used were of analytical grade.\n\nAdsorption experimental procedure\nAdsorption was carried out in a batch process by contacting 300 mg of DNES-CH composite with 50 mL of 20 mg/L of copper solution. In the preliminary step, all adsorption experiments were conducted in 250 mL Erlenmayer flasks using one variable at a time. The flasks containing the adsorbate and the adsorbent were agitated on an orbital shaker (REMI make CIS-24BL) at 180 rpm and 30 °C temperature. Samples were taken at predetermined time intervals of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 min. For further experiments, contact time was adjusted to optimum. The effect of pH was studied in the range of 2–9. With optimum contact time and pH, metal solutions in the concentration range of 20–100 mg/L were used to assess the effect of initial copper ion concentration. Similarly, the adsorbent dose was varied from 150 to 450 mg and finally temperature was varied between 10 and 50 °C. Each of the experiments was repeated twice and the average values were obtained. At the end of each adsorption process, the adsorbate was filtered out through whatman filter paper and the residual metal concentration was determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu make AA-6300) with copper hallow cathode lamp using air acetylene flame at a wavelength of 324.8 nm. The percentage removal was obtained by using the following expression: 1 Percentageremoval(\\% )ofmetal=Co-Ce/Co×100 where Co is the initial concentration of stock sample (mg/L), Ce is the final concentration of stock sample after adsorption (mg/L).\n\nAdsorption kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamic studies\nKinetic models including pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion were used to determine the rate of adsorption of copper. The sorption equilibrium between the adsorbent and the metal ions was described by using Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin models. For all the three models, the isotherm constants were obtained by non-linear regression methods. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated using Van’t Hoff equation.\n\nExperimental design and statistical analysis\nThree level full factorial design of RSM was used to optimize the chosen design variables (Ghaedi et al. 2015; Srivastava et al. 2014) for the optimization of copper adsorption by DNES–CH composite. Experiments with three initial adsorbent dosages (X1) 7, 8 and 9 g/L, initial metal (adsorbate) concentrations (X2) 15, 20 and 25 mg/L and initial pH values (X3) 5, 6 and 7 were employed simultaneously according to the design. Experiments (28 runs) were conducted to describe the effects of all the three variables on adsorption. The coded values of the process parameters were determined by the equation 2 xi=Xi-XoΔX where xi is the coded value of the ith variable, Xi is the uncoded value of the ith test variable and Xo is the uncoded value of the ith test variable at the center point. The levels of the coded variables are given in Table 1. The behaviour of the experimental design is explained by the following polynomial second order equation 3 Y=β0+∑i=1kβiXi+∑i=1kβiiXi2+∑i=1k-1∑j=2kβijXiXj Design expert 9 (Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) software trial version was used for statistical analysis of the experimental results. Regression equation was solved using fmincon function of Matlab 2008 and with the optimum values obtained, surface plots were drawn.Table 1 Full factorial design for adsorption of copper by DNES–CH composite\n\nRun no.\tCoded values\tUnoded values\t% Adsorption\tResidual\t% Error\t\n\nX\n1\n\t\nX\n2\n\t\nX\n3\n\t\nX\n1\n\t\nX\n2\n\t\nX\n3\n\tActual\tPredicted\t\n1\t−1\t−1\t−1\t7\t15\t5\t69.24\t68.36\t0.88\t1.27\t\n2\t0\t−1\t−1\t8\t15\t5\t88.26\t90.67\t−2.41\t2.73\t\n3\t1\t−1\t−1\t9\t15\t5\t83.87\t80.75\t3.12\t3.72\t\n4\t−1\t0\t−1\t7\t20\t5\t76.38\t78.08\t−1.67\t2.18\t\n5\t0\t0\t−1\t8\t20\t5\t95.97\t94.52\t1.45\t1.51\t\n6\t1\t0\t−1\t9\t20\t5\t74.85\t78.77\t−3.92\t5.23\t\n7\t−1\t1\t−1\t7\t25\t5\t83.87\t83.15\t0.72\t0.85\t\n8\t0\t1\t−1\t8\t25\t5\t93.63\t93.79\t−0.16\t0.17\t\n9\t1\t1\t−1\t9\t25\t5\t74.18\t72.20\t1.98\t2.66\t\n10\t−1\t−1\t0\t7\t15\t6\t71.68\t72.18\t−0.50\t0.69\t\n11\t0\t−1\t0\t8\t15\t6\t91.19\t92.40\t−1.21\t1.32\t\n12\t1\t−1\t0\t9\t15\t6\t81.43\t80.39\t1.04\t1.27\t\n13\t−1\t0\t0\t7\t20\t6\t81.33\t80.87\t0.46\t0.56\t\n14\t0\t0\t0\t8\t20\t6\t98.27\t95.25\t3.02\t3.07\t\n15\t1\t0\t0\t9\t20\t6\t74.12\t77.40\t−3.28\t4.42\t\n16\t−1\t1\t0\t7\t25\t6\t85.12\t84.98\t0.14\t0.16\t\n17\t0\t1\t0\t8\t25\t6\t90.99\t93.52\t−2.53\t2.78\t\n18\t1\t1\t0\t9\t25\t6\t69.66\t69.83\t−0.17\t0.24\t\n19\t−1\t−1\t1\t7\t15\t7\t74.12\t74.37\t−0.25\t0.33\t\n20\t0\t−1\t1\t8\t15\t7\t93.63\t92.49\t1.14\t1.21\t\n21\t1\t−1\t1\t9\t15\t7\t76.56\t78.39\t−1.83\t2.39\t\n22\t−1\t0\t1\t7\t20\t7\t81.47\t82.06\t−0.59\t0.72\t\n23\t0\t0\t1\t8\t20\t7\t94.87\t94.34\t0.53\t0.55\t\n24\t1\t0\t1\t9\t20\t7\t75.39\t74.40\t0.99\t1.31\t\n25\t−1\t1\t1\t7\t25\t7\t85.97\t85.16\t0.81\t0.94\t\n26\t0\t1\t1\t8\t25\t7\t88.75\t91.61\t−2.86\t3.22\t\n27\t1\t1\t1\t9\t25\t7\t67.89\t65.83\t2.06\t3.03\t\n28\t0\t0\t0\t8\t20\t6\t98.27\t95.25\t3.02\t3.07\t\n\n\nCharacterization of the biosorbent\nTo observe the surface changes of the adsorbent after sorption of the metal ions and in situ metal analysis, SEM (EVO 18 make Carl Zeiss) and EDS (Oxford instrument, Inca) analyses were employed respectively. To know the main functional groups present on the adsorbent and their interaction with the metal ions, Fourier transform Infrared (Bruker UK, ATR) analysis was performed. The adsorbent was also characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique using X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The measurement was in the scanning range of 5–100 at a scanning speed of >19.685 s−1.\n\nResults and discussion\nEffect of contact time\nThe results showed that the percentage removal of copper increased briskly up to 60 min reaching 93.925 % (Fig. 1a). Beyond 60 min, the % of adsorption remained the same indicating the attainment of equilibrium conditions. Equilibrium indicates utilization of the more readily available adsorbing sites especially the carboxyl and the amino groups present on the DNES–CH composite surface. Initial rates of sorption are faster due to the availability of adequate vacant surface binding sites and the vanderwaal forces of attraction between the adsorbate and the adsorbent. With the advancement of time, sorption becomes gradually tapered due to repulsive forces between the solute molecules of the solid and the bulk phases; consequently, the remaining vacant binding sites fail to bind with the metals (Srivastava et al. 2014). The reported contact time of 150 min for removal of copper by chick egg shells by packed-bed sorption (Nabil and Sameer 2009) is much higher than the optimum contact time of 60 min for the composite in the present study.Fig. 1 \na Effect of contact time on % adsorption of copper. b Effect of pH on % adsorption and metal uptake of copper. c Effect of initial metal concentration on % adsorption and metal uptake of copper. d Effect of adsorbent dosage on % adsorption and metal uptake of copper. e Effect of temperature on % adsorption and metal uptake of copper\n\n\n\nEffect of pH on adsorption\nThe pH of the aqueous metal solution affects sorption through the adsorbent surface charge, the degree of ionization and speciation of the adsorbate as well. Maximum  % removal of copper was 94.47 % at pH 6 (Fig. 1b) and this is in agreement with the earlier research reports (Rafatullah et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2012). At pH < 5, the number of sites available for metal adsorption will be low as most of the functional groups are protonated and H3O+ ions compete with the metal for the adsorption sites on the adsorbent. At pH 6, the increase in adsorption could be attributed to the weak inhibitory effect of H3O+ ions. At pH above 6, the adsorption rates were unpredictable due to accumulation of metal ions on the adsorbent.\n\nEffect of initial metal ion concentration\nThe maximum percentage removal of copper observed was 94.47 % when the initial copper concentration was 20 mg/L (Fig. 1c). The plot suggests that the metal ion adsorption increased sharply in the beginning and then decreased slowly with further increase in the initial concentration. This can be attributed to the increase in adsorbate concentration to a fixed number of available active sites on the adsorbent (Malkoc 2006).\n\nEffect of adsorbent dosage\nThe experiments were carried out by varying the adsorbent loading from 3 to 9 g/L. The percentage removal of copper by DNES-CH composite at different adsorbent doses is presented in Fig. 1d. Experimental studies were carried out at 30 °C with an initial metal concentration of 20 mg/L at pH 6. The removal of copper increased rapidly from 89.215 to 94.51 % with an increase in the adsorbent dose from 3 to 8 g/L. As shown in the figure, the percentage removal increased initially with the increase of the adsorbent dose due to increased surface area of the adsorbent and the number of binding sites. For a fixed initial metal concentration, although the adsorbent dose was increased, there was no significant change in the adsorption after attaining the equilibrium (Witek-Krowiak et al. 2011; Moreno-Pirajan et al. 2011).\n\nEffect of temperature\nAdsorption is expected to increase by an increase in temperature owing to the increase in the rate of diffusion of the adsorbate molecules across the external boundary layer and into the internal pores of the adsorbent particles. In this case, copper uptake marginally increased from 93.43 to 94.51 % for DNES–CH composite with increasing temperature from 10 to 30 °C indicating that the adsorption of copper on to the adsorbent is an endothermic process. With further rise in temperature beyond 30 °C, the increase in copper uptake was only marginal (Fig. 1e).\n\nAdsorption kinetics\nThe kinetics of adsorption of copper at different contact times was found out using the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and intra-particle diffusion models. The pseudo-first order equation is 4 logqe-qt=logqe-K1/2.303t where qe and qt are the amount of metal adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t; K1 is the rate constant of pseudo-first order (min−1). 5 The pseudo-second order equation ist/qt=1/K2qe2+1/qe(t) where K2 (min−1) is the pseudo-second order rate constant.\n\nIntra-particle diffusion equation is 6 qt=Kintt1/2+C where Kint is intra-particle diffusion rate constant (mg/g min1/2) and C is the boundary layer thickness.\n\nThe pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intra-particle diffusion kinetic plots are given in Fig. 2a–c respectively. In the pseudo-first order, the K1 and qe values were 0.0582 (min−1) and 1.2103 (mg/g) respectively with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9586. In the pseudo-second order, the K2 and qe values were 0.1104 (min−1) and 3.2362 (mg/g) respectively with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9989. The intra-particle diffusion, a plot of solute sorbed against square root of contact time, should normally yield a straight line passing through the origin but the line in the present case, did not pass through the origin and the values of Kint and C were 0.1341 (mg/g min½) and 2.0427 (mg/g) respectively with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.8942. From the experiments, qe obtained was 3.1308 mg/g which is suggestive that the adsorption of copper by DNES–CH composite could be by chemisorption, appropriately explained by the pseudo-second order model.Fig. 2 \na Pseudo-first order kinetics for adsorption of copper using DNES–CH composite. b Pseudo-second order kinetics for adsorption of copper using DNES–CH composite. c Intra-particle diffusion kinetics for adsorption of copper using DNES–CH composite\n\n\n\nAdsorption isotherm\nThe experimental data were tested and compared with the three isotherm models viz. Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin. Langmuir isotherm is the most widely used model and the equation is given as 7 ce/qe=1/bqm+ce/qm The equation obtained for the Langmuir isotherm (Fig. 3a) for the current data was ce/qe = 0.0207ce + 0.3339 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9934 indicating the strong binding of copper ions on to the surface of the adsorbent. The maximum metal uptake (qmax) obtained was 48.3 mg/g and the separation factor (RL) was 0.9358, indicating that the adsorption is favorable (0 < RL < 1). Freundlich isotherm, applied in the cases of low and intermediate concentration ranges, is given by 8 qe=KfCe1/n where Kf and n are the adsorption capacity and intensity respectively. Freundlich equation linearized in logarithmic form as follows: 9 logqe=logKf+nlogCe with the experimental data represented in Fig. 3b, the Freundlich equation obtained was log qe = 0.8334 log Ce + 0.4684 with a correlation coefficient of 0.999. As the n value was 0.8334, which is in between 0 < n < 1, good adsorption of copper ions over the entire range of concentrations studied was inferred. The Kf value obtained was 2.9403 mg/g. Temkin isotherm equation describes the behavior of many adsorption systems on the heterogeneous surface. The linear form of the equation 10 qe=RT/bTlnAT+RT/bTlnce was used for analyzing the experimental data and presented in Fig. 3c. The equation obtained for copper adsorption was qe = 6.3177 ln ce + 1.6182 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9609.Fig. 3 \na Langmuir isotherm for adsorption of copper using DNES–CH composite. b Freundlich isotherm for adsorption of copper using DNES–CH composite. c Temkin isotherm for adsorption of copper using DNES–CH composite\n\n\n\nThe applicability of each model was evaluated using error analysis (χ2). To find out the best-fit isotherm, the non-linear Chi square test statistic (χ2) 11 χ2=Σqe,exp-qe,cal2/qe,cal where, qe,expqe,cal are experimental and calculated adsorption capacity values respectively, was used (Ho and Ofomaja 2005).\n\nThe good agreement of the data acquired by each model needs that the χ2 value is a smaller number while the non-applicability of the model has larger χ2 value. The isothermal constants and χ2 values are indicated in Table 2. With the use of the Chi square test (χ2) characteristic and the regression correlation coefficient R2, the best isothermal model was identified as the Langmuir followed by the Temkin and the Freundlich isothermal models.Table 2 Isotherm constants of copper adsorption onto DNES–CH composite\n\nLangmuir\tFreundlich\tTemkin\t\n\nq\nmax = 48.3 mg/g\t\nn = 0.8334\t\nA\nT = 1.2918\t\n\nR\nL = 0.9358\t\nK\nf = 2.9403 mg/g\t\nb\nT = 398.743\t\n\nR\n2 = 0.9934\t\nR\n2 = 0.999\t\nR\n2 = 0.9609\t\n\nχ\n2 = −0.00054\t\nχ\n2 = 11.4896\t\nχ\n2 = 0.2242\t\n\n\nThermodynamic studies\nTo investigate the nature of adsorption, thermodynamic parameters viz. enthalpy (ΔH°), entropy (ΔS°) and Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) were estimated. The following Van’t Hoff equation was used to evaluate thermodynamic parameters: 12 logqe/ce=ΔH/2.303RT+ΔS/2.303R The negative value of ΔH indicates an exothermic reaction; a positive value denotes an endothermic reaction. If the value of ΔS is less than zero, it indicates the process is highly reversible and if more than or equal to zero, it indicates the irreversibility of the process. The negative value of ΔG indicates the spontaneity of adsorption whereas a positive value of ΔG indicates the non spontaneity of adsorption. Van’t Hoff plot is represented in Fig. 4 and the equation obtained was log (qe/ce) = 0.3105(1/T) + 1.3481. The positive experimental ΔH° value indicates that the adsorption process was endothermic in nature and there was a possible strong bonding between the metal ion and the adsorbent. As ΔS° was more than zero, the adsorption process appears to be irreversible (Desorption studies were hence not attempted). The Gibbs free energy is negative, suggesting the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process. The free energy change (ΔG°) increased with increase in temperature (10–50 °C), presumably due to activation of more sites on the surface of the adsorbent (Sengil and Ozacar 2008). The thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures are given in Table 3.Fig. 4 Van’t Hoff plot for adsorption of copper using DNES–CH composite\n\nTable 3 Thermodynamic parameters calculated by Van’t Hoff equation\n\nTemperature (°K)\t∆G° (kJ/mol)\t∆H° (kJ/mol)\t∆S° (kJ/mol K)\t\n283\t−7298.9075\t5.9451\t25.8122\t\n293\t−7557.0295\t\t\t\n303\t−7815.1515\t\t\t\n313\t−8073.2735\t\t\t\n323\t−8331.3955\t\t\t\n\n\nThe maximum adsorption capacities of a few common adsorbents for copper are shown in Table 4. When compared to the synthetic adsorbents, the maximum adsorption capacity of the natural DNES–CH composite is low. But the advantages of the composite are good enough in minimizing sludge generation and the recovery of the metal from the effluents.Table 4 Comparison of the adsorption capacities (q\nmax) of different adsorbents\n\nAdsorbent\t\nq\nmax (mg/g)\tReferences\t\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n\t5.83\tTuzen et al.

With these preliminary results, further experiments on the factors affecting adsorption were carried out using three level full factorial design under RSM with varying levels of adsorbent dosage, metal ion concentration and pH.\n\nThe coded and the actual values of the test variables are as given in Table 1. Multiple regression analysis of the data for adsorption yielded the following regression equation. 13 Y=+95.25-1.74X1+0.56X2-0.089X3-5.84X1X2-2.09X1X3-1.00X2X3-16.11X12-2.29X22-0.82X32 where Y is the % adsorption of copper, X1 adsorbent dosage, X2 is the metal ion concentration and X3 is the pH. Solving the regression equation using fmincon function, the optimum set of values for the three variable X1, X2 and X3 were −0.0960, +0.2651 and −0.0936. Hence, it was inferred that for maximum adsorption of copper with the DNES-CH composite, the adsorbent dosage, metal ion concentration and pH should ideally be kept at 7.90 g/L, 20.2651 mg/L and 5.906 respectively.\n\nInterpretation of the regression analysis\nStatistical testing of the model by the Fischer’s statistical test for analysis of variance (ANOVA) yielded a F-value of 46.25 with a low p value (p < 0.0001) indicating the significance of the model (Table 5). Determination coefficient nearer to unity (R2 = 0.9585) indicates that only 4.15 % of the total variations are not explained by the model. The predicted R2 of 0.8977 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted R2 of 0.9378 (difference is less than 0.2). The results of the full factorial design are represented in Table 6 and it is inferred that the quadratic model is the best fit for the observed biosorption of copper by DNES–CH composite.Table 5 Regression coefficients for adsorption of copper by DNES–CH composite\n\nModel term\tCoefficient estimate\tStandard error\t\nF value\t\np value\t\nIntercept\t95.25\t1.06\t46.25\t<0.0001\t\n\nX\n1\n\t−1.74\t0.55\t9.87\t0.0056\t\n\nX\n2\n\t0.56\t0.55\t1.03\t0.3240\t\n\nX\n3\n\t−0.089\t0.55\t0.026\t0.8739\t\n\nX\n1\nX\n2\n\t−5.84\t0.68\t74.48\t<0.0001\t\n\nX\n1\nX\n3\n\t−2.09\t0.68\t9.59\t0.0062\t\n\nX\n2\nX\n3\n\t−1.00\t0.68\t2.19\t0.1563\t\n\nX\n12\n\t−16.11\t0.93\t301.46\t<0.0001\t\n\nX\n22\n\t−2.29\t0.93\t6.11\t0.0236\t\n\nX\n32\n\t−0.82\t0.93\t0.78\t0.3898\t\nAll the linear, interaction and squared terms are significant (p < 0.5), excluding linear X\n3\n\n\nTable 6 Results from full factorial design for copper adsorption by DNES–CH composite\n\nSource of variation\tSum of squares\t\ndf\n\tMean square\t\nF value\t\np > F\n\t\nModel\t2285.25\t9\t253.92\t46.25\t<0.0001\t\nLack of fit\t98.82\t17\t5.81\t\t\t\nPure error\t0.000\t1\t0.000\t\t\t\nTotal\t2384.08\t27\t\t\t\t\n\n\nInteraction effects of biosorption variables\nTo know the interactive effects of biosorption variables, surface plots drawn using Matlab 2008 are provided in Fig. 5a–c. From the curvature of the contour, it was identified that the biosorpiton of copper is strongly influenced by the adsorbent dosage, initial metal concentration and pH.Fig. 5 \na Surface plot for the effects of adsorbent dosage and initial metal concentration of copper on % removal. b Surface plot for the effects of adsorbent dosage and pH of copper on % removal. c Surface plot for the effects of pH and initial metal concentration of copper on % removal\n\n\n\nSEM–EDS analysis\nSEM analyses of the biosorbent material, DNES–CH composite, before and after adsorption of copper are presented in Fig. 6a, b, respectively. After adsorption of copper, the surface morphology of the adsorbent changed to rough, more uneven and heterogeneous nature which could probably be due to the reorganization of surface functional groups binding the metal ions. From the EDS analysis before biosorption, the major constituent of the eggshells—CaCO3, along with the elements N (chitosan provides amino groups), P and the metals Mg, Na, K, Mn, Zn, Fe, Al, Sr etc. is evident to be present in the composite (Fig. 7a). After adsorption of copper (Fig. 7b), the EDS analysis showed the presence of copper ions (3.71 %) with a concomitant decrease in the percentages of Mg, Na and Zn, suggesting that the adsorption of copper by the composite may also include the ion-exchange mechanism.Fig. 6 \na SEM micrograph of native DNES–CH composite. b SEM micrograph of DNES–CH composite after adsorption of copper\n\nFig. 7 \na EDS micrograph of native DNES–CH composite. b EDS micrograph of DNES–CH composite after adsorption of copper\n\n\n\nAdsorption mechanism through FTIR spectral analysis\nThe adsorption mechanism was investigated using FTIR analysis of the native DNES, native and the metal loaded DNES-CH composite in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 (Fig. 8a–c). The native DNES FTIR spectra showed sharp peaks at 874, 1418 cm−1 but after forming composite with chitosan, provided a number of functional groups which correspond to the amino and the carboxyl. In DNES-CH composite, ES is porous in nature and provides an efficient and strong support for the CH in forming the scaffold with more number of hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino and alcohol groups available to chelate the copper metal ions. FTIR spectra showed marked differences before and after adsorption of copper. Broadly, the spectrum could be divided into three distinct regions viz. 630–1000, 1180–3000, and 3300–3700 cm−1 wherein there are significant variations in the absorption patterns and the groups assigned for biosorption as given in Table 7.Fig. 8 \na FTIR spectrum of native DNES. b FTIR spectrum of native DNES–CH composite. c FTIR spectrum of copper loaded DNES–CH composite\n\nTable 7 FTIR peaks and their corresponding groups\n\nDNES–CH composite spectrum peaks (λ)\tCopper treated DNES–CH composite, spectrum peaks (λ)\tAssignment\t\n3747\t3755, 3717\tO–H & N–H groups\t\n3357\t3376\t\t\n3304\t3338\t\t\n2986\t3001\tCarboxyl groups\t\n1741\t1717\tAmines\t\n1550\t1508\tN–H bending vibration\t\n1398\t1389\tC-N, Amines\t\n1224\t1182\t\t\n1022\t963\t\t\n869\t872\tNH3 rocking vibration\t\n651\t632\tCu–O stretching\t\n\n\nAfter interaction with the copper ions, it was identified that the sharp band at 3747 split into 3755 and 3717 cm−1 indicating that both O and N atoms present on the adsorbent surface played a significant role in binding the metal ions (Table 7); the bands at 3357 and 3304 cm−1 were assigned to O–H & N–H, and inter hydrogen bonds’ vibration shifted to 3376 and 3338 cm−1. A shift of band at 2986 cm−1 to a broad wide band at 3001 cm−1 indicates the involvement of carboxyl groups. After exposure to copper, the bands corresponding to amine shifted from 1741 to 1717 cm−1 and the bands at 1684, 1646 cm−1 disappeared. Moreover, the adsorption intensity for the N–H bending vibration at 1550 and 1508 cm−1 shifted to 1495 cm−1 and decreased after copper uptake. This observation is supported by an extreme change in absorption intensity for C–N stretching vibrations at 1398–1389 cm−1. The metal ion uptake has led to a significant change in the absorption intensity of NH3 rocking vibration from 869 to 872 cm−1. Variations in the absorption peaks at 630–700 cm−1 in the two samples (before and after treatment with copper) are indicative of Cu–O stretching in the copper loaded DNES-CH (Vinod and Miroslav 2013). In general, the adsorption capacity depends upon the porosity as well as functional groups present on the adsorbent surface (Kumar et al. 2010). Accordingly, the observed changes in the adsorption intensity and the wave number of functional groups strongly suggest the occurrence of complexation between N and O atoms on the adsorbent binding sites and the copper ions. The FTIR analysis suggests that the maximum adsorption of copper by the DNES–CH composite is due to the availability of more number of N and O atoms.\n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis\nThe native DNES–CH X-ray diffractogram (as shown in Fig. 9a) exhibited sharp peaks at 2θ positions 29°, 34°, 44°, 48°, 49°, 58°, 61°, 65°, 74°, 82°, 84°, 94°, 95° and 100°. X-ray diffractogram analysis of the copper loaded DNES–CH composite (as shown in Fig. 9b) showed the amorphous nature, with sharp peaks at 2θ positions of 20°, 22°, 23°, 25°, 27°, 28°, 30°, 48° and 85°. In addition, the peaks at 43.7°, 50° and 74.2° (JCPDS copper: 04-0836) suggest the presence of copper while the peaks at 2θ positions of 32.3°, 35.2°, 38°, 46.2°, 48.6°, 51.7°, 53.4°, 56.8°, 58.1°, 65.9°, 66.1°, 68.0°, 71.5°, 72.7°, 74.7°, 82.2°, 83.0°, 83.6°, 87.6° and 89.5° (JCPDS CuO: 80-1916) indicate the formation of CuO by the reaction of the metal with the hydroxyl and the carboxyl groups present on the adsorbent. The said reaction may be due to the electron pair sharing between the copper metal and the reactive carboxyl/hydroxyl groups in the DNES–CH composite.Fig. 9 \na XRD of native DNES–CH composite. b XRD of DNES–CH composite treated with copper\n\n\n\nConclusions\nInitial experiments following the methodology of ‘one variable at a time’ were conducted for adsorption of copper by varying the factors: contact time, temperature, adsorbate pH, adsorbate concentration, adsorbent size and adsorbent dosage. From the experimental data, the equilibrium was found to be attained at 60 min of contact time due to the presence of more and/or active functional groups. The percentage removal of copper decreased with the increase in the initial concentration of the adsorbate. The copper removal increased rapidly with the increasing adsorbent dosage initially, and attained equilibrium at 8 g/L. Percentage removal of copper from aqueous solution increased significantly with the increase in pH from 4 to 6; thereafter further increase in pH decreased the percentage removal. In a nut shell, the results of the present study demonstrate that DNES-CH composite could be considered for the effective and economic treatment of the industrial waste water containing copper, and achieve levels well below the permissible limit of 1.3 mg/L of copper suggested for safe drinking water.\n\n\nAbbreviations\nDNESDromaius novaehollandiae eggshell\n\nCHChitosan\n\nAASAtomic absorption spectrophotometer\n\nSEMScanning electron microscopy\n\nFTIRFourier transform infrared spectroscopy\n\nXRDX-ray diffractometer\n\nThe first author expresses her indebtedness to the management and the Principal of Bapatla Engineering College, Bapatla, India for providing the laboratory facilities.

Normal and streptozotocin-diabetic rats were orally administered cyanobacteria for 60 consecutive days, and their blood levels of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, lipid peroxidation, body weight and enzyme changes were determined using standard methods. Cyanobacteria administration reduced blood glucose level, and increased plasma insulin, C-peptide levels and restored the body weight. Cyanobacteria administration significantly reduced lipid peroxidation in the diabetic rats. Hexokinase enzyme activity was increased, whereas glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme activity decreased in streptozotocin-diabetic rats compared to their respective controls. Cyanobacteria administration caused significant renormalization of serum hepatic enzymes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is due to the body’s failure to produce enough amount of insulin. Type 2 diabetes mellitus starts with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells unable to respond to insulin properly (Muthuraman et al. 2014a, b). The number of diabetics is tremendously increasing in developing countries due to lifestyle (Sridhar et al. 2002). The careful control of blood glucose is a vital part of the management of diabetic complications (Muthuraman and Srikumar 2009). There are several anti-diabetic drugs available to control blood glucose level; however, these drugs produce side effects. There are five major kinds of anti-diabetic drugs such as sulfonylureas, meglitinides, biguanides, thiazolidinediones and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors available in the market. However, these drugs produce several side effects such as hypoglycemia, skin allergy, skin rash, gastrointestinal upset, fluid retention, edema, weight gain, lactic acidosis, nausea, diarrhea, liver function impairment and flatulence. Therefore, a search of the novel anti-diabetic drug without any side effect is mandatory in the clinical research.\n\nThe intravenous injection of streptozotocin in male albino Wistar rats makes pancreas swell and causes degeneration of Langerhans islet beta cells of the pancreas and induces experimental diabetes mellitus within 72 h. Streptozotocin induces one type of diabetes which is similar to diabetes mellitus with non-ketosis hyperglycemia. Induction of diabetes with Streptozotocin decreases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in pancreatic islet beta cells and causes histopathological effects in beta cells of the pancreas which probably intermediates induction of diabetes.\n\nSeveral natural products have isolated from a broad range of taxa and tested for biomedical potential. These active components from plant origin have provided several crucial molecules for drug designing. The search of products from natural sources has revolutionized the programs of drug discovery. Several plant-derived molecules have shown a promising potential effect in therapeutics. The use of plant medicines in the treatment of several diseases such as central nervous system disorders is a traditional practice. The cyanobacteria (spirulina platens) have been recognized for their wide abundance. Cyanobacteria are considered as good candidates for applications in agriculture, food industry and pharmaceuticals. Antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, algaecides and cytotoxic activities of cyanobacteria have been reported (Senthilkumar and Ahmed John 2008). Cyanobacteria contain secondary metabolites, bioactive peptides, macrolides and glycosides (Matthew et al. 2010). Cyanobacteria occur naturally in tropical and subtropical lakes with high pH and high concentrations; therefore, their concentrated nutritional profile makes it ideal for those preferring a whole-food supplement to artificial nutrient sources. A search for novel compounds is essential to conquering diabetes mellitus without side effect. Also, cyanobacterial strains have been well characterized, with some anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential (Nagasathya and Thajuddin 2003; Rajavel et al. 2009). Our previous study evaluated the effect of cyanobacteria on plasma insulin and increased by regeneration of pancreatic beta cells in alloxan induced diabetic rats following administration (Muthuraman et al. 2009). The present study was therefore undertaken to investigate the chronic effect of cyanobacteria in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in male albino rats.\n\nMaterials and methods\nMale Wistar strain albino rats weighing 160–180 g have used for the investigation. The animals have housed under controlled temperature and hygiene conditions in propylene cages. Commercial rat chow with free access to drinking water ad libitum was provided for the rats. Experiments were carried out in accordance with internationally accepted ethical guidelines for the care of laboratory animals. A freshly prepared solution of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg) in 0.1 M citrate buffer was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Following 3 and 4 days of streptozotocin administration, blood was collected from the rats by eye bleeding method. Rats exhibiting a blood glucose level more than 300 mg/dl were believed to be diabetic and selected for the experiment. A total of 24 rats were used for the study. Rats were divided into four groups of six animals each: group 1: normal control rats, group 2: normal rats given cyanobacteria (20 mg/kg body weight), group 3: diabetic control rats, group 4: diabetic rats given cyanobacteria (20 mg/kg body weight). Cyanobacteria were administered orally using oral gavage for 60 consecutive days. Normal saline acted as a vehicle. At the end of 60 days, blood was collected from the animals by eye bleeding method for the further experiments.\n\nPreparation of the cyanobacteria extract\nCyanobacteria have cultivated by mass culture. Biomass was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with distilled water, and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried biomass was mixed with distilled water to give a 10 % (w/v) suspension and heated at 95 °C for 30 min. The extract was purified by centrifugation at 10,000 rev/min for 15 min and stored lyophilized until use (Muthuraman et al. 2009).\n\nBiochemical profile\nBlood glucose in each sample was estimated by the standard method (Haidari et al. 2012). Plasma insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay method (Life Technologies, Korea) (Ezuruike and Prieto 2014). The C-peptide level was assayed by the chemiluminescence immunoassay method (Sigma-Aldrich, Korea) (Jones and Hattersley 2013). The body weight of rats was also determined.\n\nEnzymes\nGlycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase (Muthuraman and Srikumar 2010) and glucose-6-phosphatase (Kirana and Srinivasan 2010) have measured by kit methods (Sigma-Aldrich, Korea). Serum hepatic marker enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were measured by kit methods (Life Technologies, Korea) (Muthuviveganandavel et al. 2008).\n\nLipid peroxidation\nLipid peroxidation (LPO) was determined by the kit method (Cell Biolabs, Inc, Korea). This was based on the spectrophotometric method of Muthuraman et al. (2014a, b). MDA was measured by determining the thiobarbituric acid reactive species. The absorbance of the resultant product has measured at 534 nm (Agilent Technologies, Cary 100 UV–Vis spectrophotometer).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll values have expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis has carried with the use of SPSS 11 software. The statistical significance of differences between the means has assessed by student “t” test. A difference at p < 0.05 has considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\nCyanobacteria administration caused significant changes in the levels of glucose, plasma insulin, C-peptide, lipid peroxidation, body weights and serum hepatic marker enzymes in diabetic rats compared to control rats. Six rats were used for each analysis (n = 6). Glucose levels elevated and plasma insulin levels decreased significantly in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Body weight also seemed to be increased compared to a normal rat. However, the chronic administration of cyanobacteria restored these parameters to normal levels.\n\nBlood glucose, insulin, and C-peptide\nBlood glucose content was significantly reduced to 151.1 ± 4.1 mg/dl in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats following cyanobacteria administration, whereas it was 115.3 ± 2.7 mg/dl. The blood glucose level of the diabetic rats selected for the study was above 300 mg/dl (Fig. 1). The plasma insulin level was found to be lower 5 ± 0.08 microunit/ml in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats when compared to normal rats (13.5 ± 0.3 microunit/ml). Cyanobacteria administration significantly increased the plasma insulin level 7.9 ± 0.1 microunit/ml in diabetic rats, and to a lesser degree in normal rats (Fig. 2). A C-peptide level also was found to be lower 0.68 ± 0.02 ng/ml in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats when compared to normal rats. Cyanobacteria administration significantly increased the C-peptide level 1.1 ± 0.04 ng/ml in the male albino diabetic rats (Fig. 3).Fig. 1 Effect of cyanobacteria on serum glucose level in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic male albino rats following 60 consecutive days of dose (20 mg/k.bwt) administration.

At the end treatment time, body weights of rats were 195 ± 3.4, 188 ± 5, 140 ± 3 and 173 ± 4.1 g b.wt in group I, group II, group III and group IV, respectively. The body weight changes have calculated before and after cyanobacteria administration.\n\nGlycolytic enzyme activity\nCyanobacteria administration increased hexokinase activity 140 ± 4 units/mg of protein in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, whereas lesser (155 ± 5.3 units/mg of protein) extent in normal rats (Fig. 4). Cyanobacteria administration reduced glucose-6-phosphatase activity 0.182 ± 0.004 units/mg of protein in diabetic rats, whereas minor reductions in the normal rat (Fig. 5).Fig. 4 Effect of cyanobacteria on serum hexokinase enzyme activity in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic male albino rats following 60 consecutive days of dose (20 mg/k.bwt) administration.

Cyanobacteria administration significantly reduced lipid peroxidation level 27 ± 1.9 nmol/mg of protein in diabetic rats, whereas it was an insignificant reduction in normal rats (Fig. 6).Fig. 6 Effect of cyanobacteria on lipid peroxidation in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic male albino rats following 60 consecutive days of dose (20 mg/k.bwt) administration.

Cyanobacteria administration significantly reduced these enzyme levels, whereas minor reductions in normal rats (Table 1).Table 1 Effect of cyanobacteria on serum hepatic marker enzyme activity in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic male albino rats following 60 consecutive days of dose (20 mg/k.bwt) administration\n\nSerum hepatic marker enzymes\tControl\tControl with cyanobacteria\tDiabetic control\tDiabetic with cyanobacteria\t\nALT (U/L)\t21.9 ± 0.5\t20.1 ± 1.2\t42.0 ± 1.8\t26.0 ± 1.3***\t\nAST (U/L)\t56.2 ± 2.1\t54.0 ± 3.0\t92.3 ± 4.2\t66.5 ± 2.7*\t\nGGT (U/L)\t17.5 ± 0.9\t15.7 ± 0.8\t31.6 ± 1.5\t20.1 ± 0.6*\t\nAll the values are expressed mean ± SEM\n\n* p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001, n = 6\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWe evaluated the chronic effect of cyanobacteria on diabetic-biochemical markers such as blood glucose content, plasma insulin, C-peptide, lipid peroxidation, weight changes and glycolytic, serum hepatic marker enzyme changes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic male albino rats. Also, cyanobacteria were administered to the normal rats to evaluate the effect in normal condition. Streptozotocin has been widely used for diabetes induction in animal studies (Graham et al. 2011). Streptozotocin induced diabetes as indicated by the symptoms such as glycosuria, hyperglycemia, polyphagia, polydipsia and body weight loss (Deeds et al. 2011).\n\nCyanobacteria administration significantly renormalized altered biochemical markers in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Glucose, plasma insulin, C-peptide, lipid peroxidation and enzyme levels have evaluated in the control and treated groups. Cyanobacteria administration significantly reduced the glucose level in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, whereas no significant reduction in normal rats, which agrees with our previous findings (Muthuraman et al. 2009). Cyanobacteria administration increased plasma insulin and C-peptide levels in the diabetic rats to the near normal levels, while no significant changes have observed in the normal rats. Increased plasma insulin and C-peptide levels were indicative of the fact that cyanobacteria may enhance the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.\n\nAlso, cyanobacteria administration results in gaining weight in diabetic rats, and this may be due to its anti-hyperglycemic potential. Increased glucose-6-phosphatase could utilize for the conversion of carbohydrates to fat. Increased hexokinase enzyme activity indicates the higher rate glycolysis (Anitha and Chandra 2006). Hexokinase and glucose six phosphatase enzyme activities have not significantly changed in the normal rats following cyanobacteria administration. Reduced lipid peroxidation in diabetic rats indicates the anti-oxidant potential of cyanobacteria. ALT, AST, and GGT are indicators of hepatic damage (Whitehead et al. 1999). These enzymes increased in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats due to hepatic damage. Cyanobacteria administration reduced the activities of these enzymes to the near normal levels. Therefore, the anti-hypoglycemic action of cyanobacteria mediated through potentiation of pancreatic secretion of insulin from the intact beta cells of the islets.\n\nConclusion\nOur experimental results indicated that the cyanobacteria administration renormalized the glucose, insulin, C-peptide, lipid peroxidation and glycolytic enzymes. Also, administration of cyanobacteria leads to regaining body weight in diabetic rats. Cyanobacteria administration reversed the hepatic damage by renormalizing of serum hepatic marker enzymes. Taking all these together, cyanobacteria show anti-hypoglycemic action through potentiation of pancreatic secretion of insulin from the intact beta cells of the islets.\n\nThis work was supported by the KU Research Professor Program of Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nAuthors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAnitha L  Chandra LKR   Antidiabetic property of spirulina Diabetol Croat 2006 35 2 \nDeeds M  Anderson J  Armstrong A  Gastineau D  Hiddinga H  Jahangir A  Kudva Y   Single dose streptozotocin-induced diabetes: considerations for study design in islet transplantation models Lab Anim 2011 45 3 131 140 10.1258/la.2010.010090 21478271 \nEzuruike UF  Prieto JM   The use of plants in the traditional management of diabetes in Nigeria: pharmacological and toxicological considerations J Ethnopharmacol 2014 155 2 857 924 10.1016/j.jep.2014.05.055 24929108 \nGraham ML  Janecek JL  Schuurman HJ   The streptozotocin-induced diabetic nude mouse model: differences between animals from different sources Comp Med 2011 61 4 356 360 22330251 \nHaidari F  Shahi MM  Zarei M  Rafiei H  Omidian K   Effect of green tea extract on body weight, serum glucose, and lipid profile in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.

This genotypic characterization was undertaken to know the genetic similarity among the parental lines to be used in developing a set of chromosome segment substitution lines. In all, 253 alleles were identified using 77 polymorphic SSRs, and polymorphism information content ranged from 0.31 to 0.97 with a mean of 0.79. Cluster analysis grouped the genotypes into three clusters at a genetic similarity of 0.26–0.75. Wild accessions grouped together in cluster-I, indica cultivars formed cluster-II, and aromatic, japonica and aus types came under cluster-III. Principal component analysis also showed similar results. The genotypic data was analyzed using STRUCTURE, and genotypes were grouped into four populations. RM1018 on chromosome 4, RM8009 on chromosome 7, and RM273 on chromosome 12 amplified alleles specific to wild accessions. The information obtained from core set markers would help in selecting diverse parents including wild accessions and for tracking alleles in mapping or breeding populations.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-016-0409-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nDiversityPCAPopulation structureSSRsWild ricehttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001503Indian Council of Agricultural Research (IN)issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nRice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most extensively cultivated cereal crops in the world spreading across a wide range of geographical, ecological and climatic regions. High genotypic and phenotypic diversity exists, and about 1,20,000 different accessions are reported in rice as a consequence of varied adaptations (Das et al. 2013). Large collections of rice germplasm consisting of cultivars of indica, japonica and javanica sub-species along with landraces are conserved in global gene banks (Khush 1997; Tanksley and McCouch 1997; Lu et al. 2005; Garris et al. 2005). Wild accessions of rice are potential reservoir of valuable genes that could be exploited for crop improvement programs (Brar and Khush 1997). There was a significant reduction in genetic diversity during the course of domestication from wild relatives to cultivated rice (Brar and Khush 2003; Sun et al. 2001). In spite of the richness of genetic resources, only a small proportion has been utilized in breeding programs, resulting in high genetic similarity in commercial rice cultivars (Das et al. 2013). To meet the future requirements of food, the yield potential of the varieties has to be improved, but it is difficult due to narrow genetic base of the popular varieties. To break the yield plateau, it is essential to broaden the genetic base of the varieties by introgressions from distant or newer gene pools. Assessment and introgression of the available genetic diversity in germplasm resources is required for detection of novel genes or QTLs for agronomically important traits.\n\nKnowledge of the genetic diversity and genetic relationships between germplasm accessions is the basic foundation for crop improvement programs (Thomson et al. 2008). Domestication and artificial selection pressure changed the genome compositions and population structure of the available germplasm resources (Huang et al. 2012; Yadong et al. 2012). In depth analysis of population structure is required before initiating any breeding program to get targeted improvement in the traits. There are several ways for estimation of diversity in germplasm viz, evaluation of phenotypic variation, biochemical and DNA polymorphisms. However, both phenotypic and biochemical characterizations are not much reliable because they are environmentally influenced, labor demanding, numerically and phenologically limited, but DNA-based molecular markers are ubiquitous, repeatable, stable and highly reliable (Virk et al. 2000; Song et al. 2003). Among the several classes of available DNA markers, microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are considered the most suitable due to their multi-allelic nature, high reproducibility, codominant inheritance, abundance and extensive genome coverage (Orjuela et al. 2010). In rice, high-density SSR map with genome coverage of approximately 2 SSRs per centimorgan (cM) (McCouch et al. 2002) and a universal core genetic map (UCGM) (Orjuela et al. 2010) were reported. These maps can help in accurately assessing genomewide diversity. Many researchers evaluated genetic diversity of Indian rice germplasm using other SSRs, but SSRs from UCGM have not been used for studying diversity previously (Saini et al. 2004; Jain et al. 2004; Ram et al. 2007; Sundaram et al. 2008; Kumar et al. 2010; Sivaranjani et al. 2010; Vanniarajan et al. 2012; Yadav et al. 2013). Studies were also conducted globally on classifying rice genotypes based on their genetic diversity and population structure using molecular markers (Garris et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2010; Jin et al. 2010; Li et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2014; Raimondi et al. 2014; Shinada et al. 2014). Most of the diversity studies in rice mainly focused on clustering within cultivated rice group and only few studies were reported using accessions from wild rice species in diversity analysis (Ni et al. 2002; Ravi et al. 2003; Caicedo et al. 2007; Ram et al. 2007). The present study was aimed at investigating the diversity and relationship among selected wild rice accessions and cultivars using SSR markers for the identification of diverse genotypes and polymorphic markers for further utilization in inter-specific breeding programs, and for the development CSSL population from elite/wild crosses.\n\nMaterials and methods\nPlant material and DNA isolation\nIn this study, 23 rice genotypes were used including 4 wild accessions, 14 high yielding indica popular rice varieties along with two basmati varieties, 1 tropical japonica, 1 temperate japonica and 1 aus type from indica subspecies (Table 1). The materials were obtained from germplasm collections from the crop improvement section, Indian Institute of Rice Research, Rajendra Nagar, Hyderabad. The four wild accessions were selected based on their high photosynthesis rate (Kiran et al. 2013), and obtained from Physiology Department, IIRR. Thirty seeds per genotype were germinated in petri dishes and seedlings were transplanted in individual pots in green house. Young leaves (20 days after transplantation) were collected and genomic DNA was isolated using CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle 1987). Purity and concentration of DNA was monitored using Nano Drop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Wilmington, USA).Table 1 List of genotypes used in the study\n\nS. no\tGenotype\t\tPedigree\tYear of release\t\n1\t\nO. rufipogon-A\n\twild\t(Acc No: CR100267)\t–\t\n2\t\nO. rufipogon-B\n\twild\t(Acc No: CR100309)\t–\t\n3\t\nO. nivara-C\n\twild\t(Acc No: CR100008)\t–\t\n4\t\nO. nivara-D\n\twild\t(Acc No: CR100097)\t–\t\n5\tSwarna\t\nindica\n\tVasistha/Mahsuri\t1982\t\n6\tMTU1010\t\nindica\n\tKrishnaveni/IR64\t2000\t\n7\tMTU1081\t\nindica\n\tAjaya/BPT5204\t–\t\n8\tRasi\t\nindica\n\tTN-1/T-141\t1977\t\n9\tDhanrasi\t\nindica\n\tB32 Sel.4/O. rufipogon\n\t2002\t\n10\tKrishnahamsa\t\nindica\n\tRasi/Finegora\t1997\t\n11\tVaradhan\t\nindica\n\tSwarna/IET9314//BR327-36\t2008\t\n12\tVandhana\t\nindica\n\tC-22/Kalakeri\t2002\t\n13\tTulasi\t\nindica\n\tRasi/Finegora\t1988\t\n14\tTellahamsa\t\nindica\n\tHR12/TN1\t1971\t\n15\tSahbhagi Dhan\t\nindica\n\tIR55419-04*2/WayRarem\t2009\t\n16\tIR64\t\nindica\n\tIR5657-33-2-1/IR2061-465-1-5-5\t1991\t\n17\tJaya\t\nindica\n\tTN-1/T-141\t1968\t\n18\tBPT5204\t\nindica\n\tTN-1/F1(Mahsuri/GEB24)\t1986\t\n19\tPusaBasmati-1\t\nindica, aromatic\tPusa-150/Kernal Local\t1989\t\n20\tBasmati 370\t\nindica, aromatic\tPure line selection Dehraduni Basmati landrace\t1973\t\n21\tMoroborekan\t\ntropical japonica\n\tNA\tNA\t\n22\tNipponbare\t\ntemperate japonica\n\tNA\tNA\t\n23\tN22\t\nindica, aus\n\tSelection from Rajbhog\t1978\t\n\n\nGenotyping\n165 SSR core set primers (Orjuela et al. 2010), which are evenly distributed across 12 chromosomes with a distance ranging between 2 and 3.5 Mbp were used to estimate the genetic relatedness among 23 genotypes. PCR reactions were carried out in Thermal cycler (Veriti PCR, Applied Biosystems, USA) with the total reaction volume of 10 μl containing 15 ng of genomic DNA, 1X assay buffer, 200 μM of dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 pmol of forward and reverse primer and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific). PCR cycles were programmed as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. Amplified products were resolved on 4 % metaphor agarose gels prepared in 0.5 X TAE buffer and electrophoresis was conducted at 120 V for 2 h. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and documented using gel documentation system (Alpha imager, USA). Only clear and unambiguous bands of SSR markers were scored. Amplified fragments were scored for the presence (1) or absence (0) of the corresponding band among the genotypes, and formed a data matrix comprising ‘1’ and ‘0’.\n\nData analysis\nPolymorphism information content (PIC) of each SSR marker was computed according to the formula: PIC = 1 − ΣPi2 − ΣΣPi2 Pj2, where ‘i’ is the total number of alleles detected for SSR marker and ‘Pi’ is the frequency of the ith allele in the set of genotypes investigated and j = i + 1 (Botstein et al. 1980). Genetic relatedness among the genotypes was calculated using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages algorithm (UPGMA) by the program NTSYSpc 2.02i (Rohlf 1989). The unweighted neighbour joining (UNJ) cluster analysis followed by bootstrap analysis with 100 permutations was carried out using DARwin ver. 5.0.145 software (Perrier et al. 2003; Perrier and Jacquemoud-Collet 2006). Principal component analysis (PCA) was also done using the subroutine EIGEN using NTSYSpc 2.02i (Rohlf 1989). The genotypic data was analyzed using the graphical genotypes software (GGT 2.0) (Van Berloo 2008). The population structure was inferred through the model-based program, STRUCTURE 2.3.3 and was implemented with a burn in period of 5000 and run length of 50,000 markov chain monte carlo number (MCMC) replications for a population range from K = 2 to  10 (Pritchard et al. 2000). Final K value was determined using the Evannos ΔK method and Ln probability data was used to detect presence of genetically distinct populations using graphical approach (Evanno et al. 2005).\n\nResults and discussion\nAssessment of genetic variation in germplasm collections is essential for the efficient conservation, characterization and utilization of biodiversity. A total of 165 core set SSRs from UCGM (Orjuela et al. 2010) were used to evaluate the extent of genetic diversity within 23 rice genotypes which includes high yielding rice cultivars of indica, aus, japonica, aromatic rice and wild accessions. Among the 165 markers, 38 SSRs were monomorphic, and 50 SSRs were not considered for analysis because of ambiguous amplification. 77 (46.6 %) clearly amplified polymorphic SSRs distributed on all chromosomes were selected for the study (ESM_1). These 77 SSRs showed a total of 253 alleles at polymorphic loci. All the polymorphic loci revealed PIC values between 0.31 (RM12923) and 0.97 (RM3805), and more than 56 % loci showed PIC values in the range of 0.8–0.97. Allelic richness per locus varied from 2 (RM6464) to 9 (RM3805) with an average of 3.3 alleles. The allelic richness observed was compared to reports of Singh et al. (2013); Pachauri et al. (2013); Singh et al. (2014); Lang et al. (2014); however, it was lower when equated with Ram et al. (2007); Herrera et al. (2008); Upadhyay et al. (2012); Wang et al. (2013). The high polymorphism in these studies may be contributed by the number and diversity of germplasm accessions used including wild species and land races, and also by number and type of SSRs utilized in genotyping.\n\nThe SSR locus RM3805 on chromosome 6 showed 9 alleles in the 23 genotypes and had the highest PIC value of 0.97, followed by RM6842 on chromosome 2 with 8 alleles, and RM23914, RM7075, RM7485, RM3850, RM1369 with 6 alleles each on chromosomes 1, 2, 6 and 8, respectively. In the amplicons, di-nucleotide repeats (54.5 %) were found to be polymorphic, exhibiting high PIC values (>0.7) followed by tri-nucleotide and tetra-nucleotide repeats. In this study, an average PIC value of 0.79 was observed which is higher than reported in previous studies of Ravi et al. (2003) (0.57); Ram et al. (2007) (0.7); Upadhyay et al. 2012 (0.52); Pervaiz et al. (2010) (0.56); Singh et al. (2013) (0.25); Pachauri et al. (2013) (0.38); Babu et al. (2014) (0.50) and Singh et al. (2014) (0.42). This indicates that the SSR markers selected in this study were highly informative. Thus, the subset of rice universal core markers used in the study are useful for diversity analysis of a wide range of genotypes, especially between the cultivars and wild accessions because of their highly polymorphic nature and uniform distribution across the genome (Orjuela et al. 2010; Ali et al. 2010). The results will also be useful in selecting diverse genotypes and polymorphic SSR markers in inter-specific breeding programs and QTL mapping studies in rice. The polymorphic markers appear to be adequate in delineating accessions according to their lineage.\n\nGenotype specific alleles\nRare alleles (alleles with a frequency less than 5 %) were identified at 11 % loci, while the frequency of the most common allele at each locus ranged from 14 % (RM5748) to 95 % (RM295). Among the markers used, 23 SSRs amplified 28 unique genotype specific alleles (Table 2). The highest number of specific alleles were amplified by 9 SSRs in O. rufipogon (Acc No CR100309) followed by Nipponbare and O. nivara (Acc No CR100008). RM1018 on chromosome 4, RM8009 on chromosome 7 and RM273 on chromosome 12 amplified a unique allele each in the wild accessions. RM8131 on chromosome 1 was able to delineate wild accessions from O. sativa cultivars except N22, an aus type of O. sativa cultivar. RM425 could help differentiate O. rufipogon (Acc No CR100309) and O.nivara (Acc No CR100008) accessions clearly. RM8004 on chromosomal and RM5543 on chromosome 7 could help distinguish the 2 O. rufipogon accessions from the 2 O. nivara accessions. The popular rice variety MTU1010 was uniquely identified using RM7075, Swarna with RM3805 and Pusa Basmati1 with RM5752.Table 2 SSR markers showing genotype-specific alleles\n\nGenotypes\tSSR markers showing unique alleles\tChr. no.\t\n\nO. rufipogon (A) (Acc No: CR100267)\tRM426\t3\t\nRM6464\t1\t\n\nO. rufipogon (B) (Acc No: CR100309)\tRM6775\t6\t\nRM426\t3\t\nRM5626\t3\t\nRM5474\t3\t\nRM3850\t2\t\nRM6\t2\t\nRM425\t1\t\nRM140\t1\t\nRM3362\t1\t\n\nO. nivara (C) (Acc No: CR100008)\tRM1369\t6\t\nRM7485\t2\t\nRM425\t2\t\n\nO. nivara (D) (Acc No: CR100097)\tRM3850\t2\t\nNipponbare\tRM7642\t3\t\nRM3585\t3\t\nRM507\t5\t\nRM3372\t3\t\nRM5474\t3\t\nRM425\t2\t\nN22\tRM8009\t7\t\nRM6367\t2\t\nRM23914\t9\t\nIR64\tRM234\t7\t\nPusaBasmati-1\tRM5752\t7\t\nSwarna\tRM3805\t6\t\nMTU1010\tRM7075\t1\t\n\n\nAmong the SSR markers used in this study, three could distinguish wild accessions from indica and japonica types, and markers were identified which shows different alleles in the premium quality rices viz., basmati and BPT5204 from other genotypes under study, so that we can clearly distinguish any mixtures or adulteration at the commercial level. Nagaraju et al. (2002) reported SSR and ISSR marker assays which help in the determination of adulteration in basmati seed with non basmati seed. Clear distinction in the wild, indica, japonica and basmati types shows their independent evolution and the power of the core SSR markers and chloroplast SNPs to discriminate the genetic relationships Garris et al. (2005). Travis et al. (2015) studied genetic diversity among 511 cultivars from Bangladesh and North East India using a 384-SNP microarray assay. They identified 191, 229 and 142 SNPs clearly distinguish indica, japonica and aus accessions, respectively, and the aus group has been further resolved into two subpopulations aus1 and aus2.\n\nConserved regions in the diverse germplasm\nThere were 38 SSR loci which were identified to be monomorphic or conserved in all the genotypes, and were distributed on all chromosomes except chromosome 7. Most of the monomorphic SSR markers showed unique single allele in all the genotypes. A few others showed either double bands (RM550, RM28118 and RM103) or multiple bands (RM6327, and RM6404) yet conserved in all the genotypes. Two SSR loci RM3805 and RM6314 showed double bands in most of the cultivars, but not in the wild accessions (ESM_2) indicating a locus duplication event during the domestication of rice.\n\nIt is interesting to note that many of these conserved monomorphic loci are reported to be associated with traits such as leaf senescence, seed dormancy, plant height, panicle number, pericarp color (Temnykh et al. 2000, 2001), and other yield related traits which are associated with crop domestication (ESM_3). It is possible that some of these monomorphic loci are linked with some important biological traits, but any major variation in these loci is probably not viable or not tolerated. Evidently, some of these loci are associated with fundamental developmental or morphological traits such as survival, adaptation, flowering and seed set.\n\nUPGMA cluster analysis\nThe dendrogram generated using UPGMA cluster analysis grouped 23 genotypes into three major clusters with Jacquard’s similarity coefficient ranging from 0.26 to 0.75 (ESM_4). The analysis revealed wide genetic variability among the genotypes. Cluster I consisted of wild accessions with genetic similarity ranging from 30 to 50 % which indicates their diversity in the rice gene pool. Similar findings of separation of wild accessions from cultivars were reported by Ravi et al. (2003) using 38 SSRs for evaluating 40 cultivars and 5 wild accessions, and Ram et al. (2007) using 25 SSRs to evaluate 35 genotypes. Cluster II was further divided into 3 sub clusters (A, B and C). Sub cluster-A, included popular high yielding genotypes viz, Swarna, MTU1010 and MTU1081 with a genetic similarity of more than 60 %. Sub cluster-B consisted of genotypes released from Indian Institute of Rice Research (IIRR) viz, Tulasi, Rasi, Dhanarasi, Varadhan and Krishnahamsa with a genetic similarity ranging from 49 to 53 %. Sub cluster-C comprised of BPT5204, IR64, Jaya and Moroberekan with a similarity coefficient from 0.42 to 0.68. It is noteworthy that in cluster II, the grouping of genotypes was associated with geographical origin or their center of development. High yielding Indian varieties viz, Swarna (MTU7029), MTU1010 and MTU1081 developed at Agricultural Research Station, Maruteru, Andhra Pradesh, grouped in sub cluster-A indicating their close genetic similarity or similarity of the parents in their pedigree. Sub cluster-B was composed of genotypes such as Rasi, Tulasi, Dhanarasi, Varadhan and Krishnahamsa developed at IIRR with two exceptions, Tellahamsa and Sahbhagidhan developed elsewhere. Sub cluster-C comprised of genotypes from different geographical origin which includes IR64 from IRRI, Philippines, and Jaya from IIRR, BPT5204 from Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh and Moroberekan, a tropical japonica type. This is also an indication that modern breeding programs involved development of highly suitable genotypes adapted to their local environments or quality preferences by crossing only the popular varieties for important agronomic traits (Babu et al. 2014). This emphasizes the need of widening the gene pool in rice by introgression of new genes from diverse sources (Ali et al. 2010). A close association among the genotypes in particular clusters is largely due to common pedigree involved in breeding of the genotypes. For instance, sub cluster-B of cluster II consists of genotypes Rasi, Tellahamsa, Jaya and BPT5204 which have TN1 as one common parent in their pedigree. Also, Tulasi and Krishnahamsa both derived from Rasi were grouped in sub cluster B. All these instances of close grouping support the robustness of the grouping even though it is based on 77 loci. Early maturing varieties viz, Rasi and Tulasi with a common pedigree in their breeding grouped in a sub cluster with a similarity index of more than 67 % (Ravidra Babu et al. 2015). Similarly the study on genetic diversity of Venezuelan cultivars by Herrera et al. 2008 and diversity of Brazilian rice cultivars by Raimondi et al. 2014, demonstrated the narrow genetic base of the cultivars developed in their respective countries which can lead to genetic vulnerability to any emerging stress conditions.\n\nCluster III included two aromatic rice genotypes Basmati370 and Pusa Basmati1 which are closely related with a genetic similarity of 75 %. The unrooted neighbor-joining tree (UNJ) constructed using DARwin was in agreement with the UPGMA analysis, where the genotypes grouped into three major clusters. The boot strap analysis was done for 100 permutations and the boot strap values above 50 were considered and depicted in Fig. 1. Most of the clusters showed moderate to high boot support (57–100 %).Fig. 1 Neighbor joining tree illustrating the genetic relationships of the 23 genotypes\n\n\n\nThe aromatic rice Pusa Basmati-1 is derived from Basmati370 as one of the parent and both showed high genetic similarity of 75 % between them and grouped in Cluster III. This largely confirms the accuracy of the grouping using the 77 core SSR markers in our study. The japonica genotypes Nipponbare, Moroberekan and aus type N22 grouped with indica genotypes Jaya, IR64, Pusa Basmati-1 and Basamti370. This grouping of indica- japonica- aus- aromatic might be due to an introgression of alleles from different sources during the course of evolution. The grouping of japonica genotype Moroberekan with indica type Tellahamsa and of aus type N22 with Basmati370 was reported previously as well (Chakravarthy and Ram Babu 2006; Upadhyay et al. 2012). Aromatic and indica genotypes grouped separately as also reported by Jain et al. (2004); Garris et al. (2005).\n\nPopulation structure\nModel-based program STRUCTURE 2.3.4 was used to determine the genetic relationship among individual rice accessions. Simulations were conducted based on admixture model with K range from 2 to 10 with 10 iterations using all 23 genotypes which showed significant population structure at K = 4 (Fig. 2). By comparing the LnP(D) and Evanno’s DK values by increasing K from 2 to 10, we found that LnP(D) values increased up to K = 4, with the highest log likelihood score at the same position. The population structure using SSRs showed that likelihood reached a sharp peak when the number of populations was set at four, suggesting that these rice accessions can be grouped into four subpopulations.Fig. 2 Population structure (STRUCTURE) at K = 2 to K = 10 of 23 rice genotypes based on genotypic data using 77 SSRs\n\n\n\nPopulations were studied for the number of pure and admix individuals. At K = 4; population 1 had all wild accessions with 3 pure and 1 admix genotype, population 2 had 13 Indian cultivars with four admixes, population 3 consisted of popular cultivars Jaya and Nagina 22 and aromatic genotypes. In population 4, japonica cultivars were present with admixes from indica genotypes and many subgroups appeared within the major groups when K was increased from 4. The population grouping through structure analysis also showed similar result as that of the distance-based clustering. Studies on genetic diversity and population structure reported that domestication, geographical location and breeding objectives influenced the genetic structure of rice genotypes significantly (Garris et al. 2005; Lu et al. 2005; Yamamto et al. 2010; Chakhonkaen et al. 2012; Courtois et al. 2012; Yonemaru et al. 2012; Choudhury et al. 2013; Shinada et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2015). Population structure results of this study are in confirmation with global classification of rice germplasm by Garris et al. (2005), Wang et al. (2014) into indica, aus, aromatic, temperate japonica and tropical japonica. Wild accessions of O. nivara and O. rufipogon showed a clear differentiation from cultivated germplasm.\n\nPrincipal component analysis\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to understand the genetic relationships among the elite breeding lines and with the wild accessions. Among the 23 genotypes, 4 wild accessions formed a distinct cluster in the upper-right corner of 3rd quadrant, showing a clear distinction from cultivars in the two-dimensional dispersion of all genotypes (Fig. 3). The analysis for genotypes separated the accessions into four clearly separated groups with two basmati lines positioned in the bottom right corner of the diagram in the fourth quadrant, and the japonica genotype, Nipponbare and aus genotype. N22 were located close to the basmati genotypes in the same quadrant. All the Indian popular rice varieties were present in the left half of the diagram mainly in 1st and 2nd quadrant along with Moroberekan, a tropical japonica genotype.Fig. 3 Two-dimensional scaling of principal component analysis of 23 genotypes based on genotypic data using 77 SSRs\n\n\n\nThe first three principal components had Eigen values of 44.96, 10.32 and 9.46 %, and an overall maximum cumulative variation of 65 % were observed with first three components of principal coordinates. Two-dimensional scaling obtained using PCA analysis also showed the same grouping pattern as dendrogram and sorted most of the cultivars into three major clusters distributed across the quadrants. This technique has been used to partition rice genotypes based on variation in molecular as well as morphological data. Similar pattern of Eigen values were observed for first principal components in classifying rice subgroups by Seetharam et al. (2009); Maji and Shaibu (2012); Gana et al. (2013); Nachimuthu et al. (2015). Since the variation is high (≥25 %) for principal components, this information can be used along with cluster analysis to identify the related genotypes (Ahmad et al. 2015). Our results are in agreement with Adebisi et al. (2012), who reported that the first three principal components were the most important in reflecting the variation patterns among accessions. The markers associated in classifying the genotypes can be recommended in differentiating population subgroups. Comparison of PCA and dendrogram groupings revealed generally similar trends, with a minor difference in composition of clusters.\n\nConclusion\nThe present study confirmed the potential of the 77 SSRs which is a subset of universal core set SSRs (Orjuela et al. 2010) in differentiating the wild accessions from other genotypes, and were highly polymorphic, informative and had uniform distribution across the genome. They are useful for diversity analysis; marker assisted breeding programs and QTL mapping studies in rice. Genotype specific alleles identified can be utilized as species-specific diagnostic markers to identify the rice varieties in mixtures or for adulteration check when the seed morphology shows no variation. Cultivar specific alleles generated by SSR markers would be useful in variety identification and germplasm characterization after reconfirming in large population. Genotypic grouping through structure analysis, distance-based clustering and principal component analysis were similar confirming the results. Most of the genotypes grouped according to the geographical region, pedigree and genetic similarity. The diverse chromosomal segments harboring unique alleles specific to wild accessions of O. nivara and O. rufipogon can be harnessed for the development of chromosome segment substitution lines, mapping and transferring valuable genes from wild to cultivated rice. Distant genotypes identified in the study can be used in hybridization programs for further improvement of rice germplasm to meet the future food grain requirements. Our analysis shows the close relationship of high yielding popular Indian varieties which share a similar gene pool as they originated from a few common parents. It underlines the concern that breeding within the popular cultivars will further narrow down the genetic base of an available gene pool. Breeding activities will benefit if focus is more on crosses between distant genotypes or to enhance the diversity and identification of new genes and QTLs from untapped resources for further crop improvement.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\nESM_1: List of polymorphic markers used.

Horn cancer is the most common cancer among Bos indicus animals. Increased expression of some genes due to polymorphisms increases risk of HC incidence. We successfully amplified 91 SNPs located in 69 genes in 52 samples, each of HC and HN. Equimolar concentration of amplicons from 69 PCR products of each sample was pooled and subjected to sequencing using Ion Torrent PGM. Data obtained were analysed using DNASTAR software package and case control analysis using SAS software. We found SNP present in BPIFA1 gene of B. indicus shows association with event of HC which reflects its potential to be a genetic marker. Bioinformatic analysis to detect structural and functional impact nsSNP of BPIFA1 added another layer of confirmation to our result. We successfully identified SNP associated with HC as well as demonstrated efficient approach for limited number of SNP discovery and validation in targeted genomics regions in large number of samples combining PCR amplification and Ion Torrent PGM sequencing which suits small-scale laboratories with limited budget.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-015-0351-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nSNPsHorn cancer (HC)Bos indicusBPIFA1Ion Torrent PGMissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nRecent advances in sequencing technologies give unrivalled opportunities to explore individual genomic landscapes and identify mutations related to cancer, a complex set of diseases characterised by both environmental and genetic contributions. The use of polymorphic markers like single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) assures to provide a comprehensive tool for analysing the mammalian genome with precise identification of genomic loci contributing to the cancer phenotype. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have allowed the characterisation of SNPs at genome-wide level with high densities that were previously thought to be unachievable. Thus, NGS paved the way for the fundamental understanding of mutated genes in cancer cells, affected pathways and how these data enrich our knowledge of cancer biology (Mardis and Wilson 2009).\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma is a sporadic and highly malignant neoplasm that arises from the malpighian layer of epidermis, frequently associated with solar dermatosis. It is also known as horn cancer (HC) that involves neoplastic growth derived from proliferating horn core epithelium of predominantly mid-aged zebu bullocks affecting 1 % of cattle population (Naik et al. 1969) and causing huge economic losses due to mortality as well as reduced draft capacity as a result of prolonged morbidity. Castrated male animals, i.e. bullocks make up 95 % of the affected animals and cows 5 %, whereas it is very rare in bulls, buffaloes, sheep and goats (Chattopadhyay et al. 1982; Damodaran et al. 1979; Gupta et al. 1980; Kulkarni 1953). The incidences of HC were found to be highest in Kankrej breed of zebu cattle followed by Gir and Malvi (Joshi et al. 2009). Poorly defined genetic landscapes, absence of specific genetic markers and lack of complete understanding of genetic basis of etiopathology pose major challenges in early diagnosis. The RNA-seq based gene expression analysis indicates altered expression of numerous genes as well as multiple pathway dysfunction in HC and significant similarity in expression profiling with human lung SCC (Koringa et al. 2013a).\n\nThe large complex genome of Bos indicus has hindered the development of genetic resources despite the economic importance of the species. Combined efforts of high-throughput sequencing and sophisticated bioinformatics analysis will result in identifying distinctive ‘molecular portraits’ that can be correlated with clinical behaviour in cancer may also be categorised as a ‘tumour marker’ for predicting prognosis of cancer (Harris et al. 2007). A total of 26,539,698 SNPs are distributed across 4,803,648 genes in dbSNP of B. taurus genome build 6.1. The genome assembly of B. indicus is not yet available; whole genome sequencing (WGS) of B. indicus is currently ongoing at our research centre. The gene expression profiling in HC of B. indicus animals was explored with identification of SNPs in aberrantly expressed genes in our primary RNA-seq based approach.\n\nIdentification of SNPs in cancer genome using exon capture followed by sequencing (Varela et al. 2011; Xiong et al. 2012) and complete genome sequencing were proven to be costly but valuable methods for the discovery of the genetic causes of rare and complex diseases (Gonzaga-Jauregui et al. 2012; Ng et al. 2010). The said methods suit well the large-scale experiments involving studies of thousands of genes at a time. As an alternative to the above approaches, we tested a newer approach of targeted amplification of complete genomic regions followed by next-generation sequencing of genes showing aberrant expression in our previous study for identifying (Koringa et al. 2013b) and correlating with HC. In addition, comparative SNP profiling of B. taurus and B. indicus was also done to enrich the dbSNP of Indian zebu cattle.\n\nMaterials and methods\nClinical samples and genomic DNA isolation\nFifty-two samples were collected from cancerous horn core mucosa in RNAlater® (Sigma) from clinically affected horn of Kankrej breed bullocks during the corrective surgery from different districts of Gujarat state, India [Supplementary Table 1]. The samples were stored immediately in liquid nitrogen and transferred to the laboratory. The representative sample was also collected in 10 % formalin for histopathological examination during each sample collection. Another set of 52 blood samples was collected from corresponding aged bullocks having normal horns. All the samples were histopathologically confirmed for cellular changes using paraffin embedding technique and H & E staining. DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nAmplicon generation using PCR\nTo amplify the genomic region of 75 genes, which were previously reported for aberrant gene expression profile and showing 100 SNPs based on a single sample transcriptome analysis (Koringa et al. 2013b), 69 pairs of specific primers were designed using the Primer 3 program (Ye et al. 2012) from the Bos_taurus_UMD_3.1.1, GenBank Assembly ID: GCA_000003055.4. There were 14 primer pairs having more than one SNP covered in their PCR product. Primers were precisely designed to have amplicon range from 250 to 346 bp so that it can be sequenced using Ion Torrent PGM 300 bp chemistry. Primer sequences, location of SNP, gene ID, amplicon size and available dbDNP ID are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Amplification of DNA was performed by PCR in 15 µl volume containing 100 ng template DNA, 10 pmol each primer, 200 nM dNTPs, 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl and 0.5U of Taq DNA polymerase (EmeraldAmp GT PCR Master Mix, Takara, Clontech Laboratories, Inc., USA) using Thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Germany). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 31 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 15 s and a final elongation step of 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed at 80 volts in a 2 % agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml). The amplified products were observed under ultra violet light (300 nm) transilluminator to confirm amplification and approximation of quantity based on intensities. The size of desired amplified product was confirmed using a 50-bp molecular weight marker (Invitrogen, USA) during agarose gel electrophoresis. All the amplicons were pooled in sample-wise manner in equimolar concentration using Nanodrop1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Each sample, after pooling, containing equal concentration of all 69 amplicons was purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., USA).\n\nSequencing of amplicons using Ion Torrent PGM™ sequencing system\nThe pooled PCR products derived from all 69 amplicons were subjected to further purification step involving the Agencourt AMPure XP DNA purification beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics GmbH, Germany) to remove primer dimers and other short fragments. The same procedure was followed in each of 52 HC and HN samples. Sample-wise pooled amplicon library concentration was estimated with Qubit2.0 using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Life Technologies, USA). From the concentration and average size of each amplicon library, amount of DNA fragments per microlitre was calculated and libraries were diluted to 2.8 × 108 DNA molecules per microlitre prior to clonal amplification. Each sample having equimolar concentration of all 69 amplicons was ligated with different barcodes [Supplementary Table 3]. Emulsion PCR was carried out using the Ion OneTouch™ 200 Template Kit v2 (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality and quantity of the enriched spheres were checked on the Guava easyCyte5 system (Millipore GmbH, Germany) as described in the appendix of the Ion Xpress Template Kit User Guide (Part Number 4467389 Rev. B, 05/2011). Sequencing of sample-wise pooled amplicon libraries were carried out on a 316 chip using Ion Torrent PGM sequencing system and employing Ion Sequencing 300 kit (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A total of five Ion Torrent PGM sequencing runs were made accommodating 20 samples in each 316 chip [Supplementary Table 4].\n\nBioinformatic and global sequence analysis\nAfter sequencing, the individual sequence read was filtered by the Ion Torrent PGM software Torrent Suite v3.6.2 to remove low quality and polyclonal sequences. Sequences matching the PGM 3′ adaptors were also automatically trimmed. All PGM quality-approved, trimmed and filtered data were exported as .sff files. Generated sequence reads were assembled using DNASTAR SeqMan NGen 11 Version: 11.2.1.25 with default parameters and the targeted variants were detected for each of the sample of HN and HC, using SeqMan Pro Version 10.0.0 against Cow-UMD_3.1genome template as reference sequence data downloaded from DNASTAR Inc. official website. The Cow-UMD_3.1 genome template contains dbSNP, gene and sequences of 3.1 build genome of B. taurus. For variant detection, a minimum coverage of 20 with at least 50 % of reads representing the targeted mutation (Q = 20; depth = 10; P not ref = 50) was considered mandatory. Manual curation was done for each SNP identified in both HC and HN. Locus for which at least 40 (out of 52) samples sequenced for each condition, i.e. HC and HN was selected and considered for further analysis in Arraystar 11. Each sample was individually genotyped based on sequencing data obtained and a case–control analysis of 100 samples (fifty cases of HC versus fifty samples of HN as a controls) using a logistic regression model with case status regressed on each SNPs genotype score in the SAS statistical analysis software package using JMP Genomics 6.1 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA).\n\nPrediction of functional impact of nsSNP\nPROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyser) is a tool which predicts impact of an amino acid substitution or indel on the biological function of a protein (http://provean.jcvi.org/index.php). This algorithm allows the best balanced separation between deleterious and neutral AASs, based on a threshold. A query sequence was provided in FASTA format and score for prediction based on default threshold −2.5. The score <−2.5 indicates deleterious effect and >−2.5 as neutral (Choi et al. 2012).\n\nInvestigation of mutant protein stability by I-Mutant 2.0\nI-Mutant 2.0 (http://folding.biofold.org/cgi-bin/i-mutant2.0) is a support vector machine-based web server for the automatic prediction of protein stability changes upon single-site mutations. The RI value (Reliability Index) is computed only when the sign of stability change is predicted and evaluated from output of the support vector machine. The input FASTA sequence of protein along with the residues change was provided for analysis of DDG value (kcal/mol) (Capriotti et al. 2005). The I-Mutant based analysis was carried out at pH 1, 4, 7, 9 and 12 looking to the sensitivity of BPIFA1 protein at different pH.\n\nPrediction of nsSNPs’ impact on surface and solvent accessibility area (SCA) of BPIFA1 protein\nSolvent accessible area (ASA) of an amino-acid is helpful for locating active sites in 3D structure of proteins. The FASTA sequence of BPIFA1 was submitted to NetSurfP server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetSurfP/) for predictions of solvent accessibility or surface accessibility of amino acids. This algorithm is based on Z score which predicts surfaces. The solvent accessibility may be buried, partially buried and exposed, i.e. low accessibility, moderate accessibility or high accessibility, respectively (Petersen et al. 2009).\n\nSNPs found to be positively correlated with HC were further analysed using PROVEAN and I-Mutant to identify effect of variants on protein structure, biological function predictions and protein stability changes.\n\nResults\nTo validate the SNPs identified in our previous study as well as to investigate the suitability of amplicon-based sequencing in identifying mutations in marginally small number of samples using Ion Torrent PGM, we successfully amplified the 91 SNPs located in 69 genes out of 100 targeted SNPs across the 75 genes in 52 samples of each HC and HN (91 % coverage of targeted SNPs). Equal amounts of DNA from 69 PCR products were pooled and subjected to Ion Torrent PGM sequencing system using 316 chip and 300 bp chemistry. Amplification of each individual locus for each sample before pooling, instead of multiplex PCR, ensured that the 69 pairs of primers were equally represented in the final product for sequencing. This is important, as different amount of DNA generated for each amplicon in multiplex PCR may introduce bias in the final representation of samples for NGS. Ion Torrent PGM constitutes a new type of next-generation benchtop sequencing platform which offers small size, low acquisition price and fast turnaround time. Here, we carried out five Ion Torrent PGM runs to analyse SNPs among two groups of 52 samples each. No obvious differences in data output between both the groups could be observed. A total data output for each sample after post run analysis using Torrent Suite Software Version 3.6.2 is given in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1.Fig. 1 Summary of amplicon sequencing runs for each sample of HC and HN using Ion Torrent PGM sequencing system\n\n\n\nSample-wise data output varies from 8.3 to 172 MB. Single-nucleotide polymorphism with quality score greater than 20 and minimum coverage 20 was analysed using DNASTAR software package. We also created a bedGraph format file for all the SNPs identified for easy upload to the UCSC genome browser for viewing the SNPs along with the genome annotations. Identified SNPs with reference position, dbSNP ID, feature name, protein change, base calling, frequency and genotype for each of HC and HN sample are given in Supplementary Table 2. We found 11 and 10 ‘reference’; 57 and 62 ‘homozygous variant’; 23 and 19 ‘heterozygous reference’; no “heterozygous nor reference’ genotype in HC and HN, respectively. Reference genotype indicates that SNP reported in our previous study (based on single sample) was not correct. Fifty-six SNPs commonly showing homozygous variant genotype in both conditions can be consider B. indicus breed specific SNPs. Sixteen SNPs commonly showing heterozygous reference genotypes in both conditions may be due to exotic inheritance in B. indicus cattle as the sampling was done based on phenotypes only. The list of SNPs showing differential genotypes is given in table below with ‘NegLog10_ProbAllele’ estimated using case–control study in Table 1.Table 1 List of SNPs showing different genotypes between HC and HN\n\nSNP ID\tRef pos\tdbSNP ID\tFeature name\tNegLog10_ProbAllele\tRef seq\tHC-called seq\tHN-called seq\tProtein change\tHC\tHN\t\nAC_000170\t63251805\t136870681\tBPIFA1\t3.398\tT\tT|C\t0.5\t0.5\tT|C\t0.2\t0.8\tF189S\tHet.

In our study SNP [T → C] at position 63251805 (dBSNP ID rs136870681) identified in BPIFA1 on chromosome number 13 of B. indicus shows association with event of HC which reflects its potential to be a ‘genetic marker’ in HC based on a case–control analysis. SNP present in BPIFA1 was already reported during WGS of B. taurus but further information about its association with any trait is not known (Liao et al. 2013).\n\n\nAnalysis of functional impact of nsSNP of BPIFA1\nTo add layer of confirmation to the effect of nsSNP of BPIFA1 on protein function, we investigated the functional impact of amino acid substitution. This algorithm predicted only one variant F189S as a neutral with score of 3.836.\n\nAnalysis of stability of BPIFA1 mutant protein\nIn order to increase overall prediction accuracy, we used I-Mutant 2.0 SVM tool for checking stability of mutant BPIFA1 protein using protein sequence at different pH. It predicted a single amino acid substitution resulting in change in protein stability with the help of regression estimator for predicting the related free energy change of protein stability (DDG values). It predicted that the BPIFA1 mutant protein F189S with value DDG < 0 and RI value =3, which indicates decreased stability at all levels of pH and temperature of 25 °C due to mutation.\n\nAnalysis of SCA of BPIFA1\nSCA is often used for calculating the transfer free energy required to move a protein from aqueous solvent to a non-polar solvent. Amino acid substitution may produce alterations in the structure of protein, especially in case of nsSNPs. Thus, it is helpful for improving prediction of protein secondary structure. In order to understand conformational changes due to amino acid substitutions, we analysed the SCA for both BPIFA1 wild and mutant sequences. The mutant were found low accessible surface area with buried class with change in RSA, ASA and Z-fit value from 0.260 → 0.264; 52.202 → 30.988 and 0.677 → 0.580 respectively.\n\nDiscussion\nIn this research paper, we tested identification and validation of targeted genomic amplification of predetermined genomic locus using NGS in a marginally small number of samples using 316 chip of Ion Torrent PGM sequencing system. We performed amplification of 75 targeted regions in 96-well PCR plates at a time following common PCR protocol. We succeeded in amplifying 69 genes. As a result of utmost care taken in quantitation of each library before pooling, we could sequence all 91 SNPs located in 69 genes with at least 20 reads covering each SNP. Our analysis suggested that the amplification of a predetermined genomic regions followed by the next-generation sequencing is an effective way to identify SNPs without going for complete sequencing of the whole genome. This approach will be effective in quickly assessing the spectrum of SNPs in important genes or genomic regions affecting HC. Similar observations were also reported in other studies related to SNP discoveries in variety of diseases (Cheng et al. 2010; Elliott et al. 2012; Junemann et al. 2012; Lopez-Doriga et al. 2014). Our approach not only identify SNPs in exons, but also SNPs located in introns and up- and downstream regions, which have been recognised more important as playing important roles in gene regulation and diseases (Jaillon et al. 2008). Despite all care taken for equimolar pooling of libraries before emulsion PCR, sample-wise data output varies significantly from 8.3 to 172 MB with an average of 69 MB; the possible reason could be preferential amplification during emulsion PCR towards genomic regions having different nucleotide sequence composition as reported in many groups of scientists across various experiments (Acinas et al. 2005; Becker et al. 2000; Kanagawa 2003; McInroy et al. 2014).\n\nWe found nine commonly found ‘reference genotype’ in both conditions that represent contrasting results to that of our previous study. Since our previous identification of SNP was based on one sample in contrast to present validation on 104 samples with sequencing depth of 20 for each SNP, the result of this research is justified. We found 56 B. indicus specific SNPs showing ‘homozygous variant genotype’ in both conditions. So far only 42 validated SNPs have been reported at dbSNP build 130 Genome build 4.1 of ‘B. indicus × B. taurus’ at GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_summary.cgi?build_id=130). SNPs validated in this study will significantly enrich database and will serve as resource for array-based genome-wide association studies. India adopted strategies to introduce exotic inheritance of B. taurus draft purpose cattle breeds to increase overall productivity resulted into some exotic inheritance is very well represented by 17.5 % SNPs commonly showing ‘heterozygous reference’ in both conditions as the sampling for present study was based on phenotypic characters only.\n\nA case control analysis of 52 cases of HC versus 52 samples of HN using JMP Genomics 6.1 of SAS identified a single SNP present in BPIFA1 gene on chromosome number 13 of B. indicus at position 63251805 significantly associated with HC. The gene BPIFA1 is also known as PLUNC (Palate, Lung and Nasal Epithelium Carcinoma associated). It is specifically expressed in upper airways and nasopharyngeal regions of mammals (Iwao et al. 2001). The exact biological function of this gene is not known; however, it has been suggested to be involved in inflammatory responses to irritants in the upper airways (Liu et al. 2013). It was suggested as a potential molecular marker for detection of micrometastasis in non-small-cell lung cancer by many groups of researchers (Benedikova et al. 2012; Iwao et al. 2001; Li et al. 2014; Yew et al. 2012). PLUNC1 regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis through miR-141, which in turn regulates PTEN and p27 expression. This signalling axis is negatively regulated by the EBV-coded gene LMP1. Thus, SPLUNC1 suppresses tumour formation and its inhibition by LMP1 provides a route for tumorigenesis (Chen et al. 2013).\n\nThe SNP identified in our study has already been reported as dBSNP ID rs136870681 in whole genome assembly of B. taurus cattle. BPI fold containing family A, member 1 (BPIFA1) gene is 7696 bp long gene with six exons in it [NCBI Reference Sequence: AC_000170.1; region from base 63247184 to 63254779]. A missense mutation at 63251805 position results in allele change TTC ⇒ TCC at 189 position amino acid substitution that resulted in F (Phe) ⇒ S (Ser) residual change (Zimin et al. 2009). In the mutation database 4 nsSNPs for the BPIFA1 gene has already been identified, but information regarding association study is not available. The PROVEAN classified this substitution mutation as a neutral in functional impact but, analysis based on I-Mutant 2.0 indicates that mutant protein has decreased stability at pH 7. Analysis of SCA resulted in low accessible surface area thought to be because of disrupt in ligand-binding site or protein binding sites that will affect protein function and alter the protein stability or folding rate (Ng and Henikoff 2006).\n\nConclusions\nWe demonstrated an efficient approach for limited number of SNP discovery and validation in targeted genomics regions in a large number of samples combining PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing technologies. Using of the 91 SNPs reported in 69 aberrantly expressed genes in HC, we showed that this approach is effective in identification and validation of SNPs. We identified SNP [T → C] in chromosome No 13 at position 63251805 (dBSNP ID rs136870681) of BPIFA1 gene and shows association with event of HC which reflects it’s potential to be a genetic marker based on case control analysis. Further investigation is required to establish this SNP as a molecular marker of HC. Other mutations in associated genes and its pathways need to be further investigated. SNPs identified in this study will enrich dbSNP database of NCBI and will be useful resource for array designing, especially for B. indicus animals. The present findings would provide basis for further screening of genes and identification of markers for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of HC.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (XLSX 64 kb)\n\n \n\nAbbreviations\nHCHorn cancer\n\nHNHorn normal\n\nAuthors wish to thank Dr. P.H.

Although in total 16 high-risk HPV strains have been identified so far. Currently available commercial vaccines are designed by targeting mainly HPV16 and HPV18 viral strains as these are the most common strains associated with cervical cancer. Because of the high level of antigenic specificity of HPV capsid antigens, the currently available vaccines are not suitable to provide cross-protection from all other high-risk HPV strains. Due to increasing reports of cervical cancer cases from other HPV high-risk strains other than HPV16 and 18, it is crucial to design vaccine that generate reasonable CD8+ T-cell responses for possibly all the high-risk strains. With this aim, we have developed a computational workflow to identify conserved cross-clade CD8+ T-cell HPV vaccine candidates by considering E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins from all the high-risk HPV strains. We have identified a set of 14 immunogenic conserved peptide fragments that are supposed to provide protection against infection from any of the high-risk HPV strains across globe.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-015-0352-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nHPVEpitopeCytotoxicT lymphocytesCervical cancerVaccineissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nCervical cancer is the second most common malignant cancer in terms of incidence and mortality rates in women worldwide after breast cancer (Pisani et al. 1993; Collins et al. 2006; Jemal et al. 2011; Senapathy et al. 2011; Torre et al. 2015). Human papilloma virus (HPV) is considered as the major etiological agent for cervical cancer which is responsible for over 265,700 total women deaths per year with around 527,600 new cases every year (Torre et al. 2015). It is estimated that about 80 % of women could acquire a HPV infection in their lifetime (Baseman and Koutsky 2005). On an average, every woman who dies due to cervical cancer loses about 26 years of life which is considerably greater than the average years of life lost to breast cancer (19.2 years) (Herzog and Wright 2007; Pandhi and Sonthalia 2011). Till now over 200 types of HPV strains have been sequenced (Bernard et al. 2010; Meiring et al. 2012; McLaughlin-Drubin 2015; Supindham et al. 2015), among them 16 are known to be high-risk virus strains (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 69, 73, and 82) (Muñoz et al. 2003; Markowitz et al. 2007; Sumalee et al. 2008; Meijer et al. 2009; Dames et al. 2014) with oncogenic HPV DNAs detected in 99 % of the cervical cancers (Dunne et al. 2007). High-risk HPV strains are in most of the cases identified as main etiological agents in cervical, anal, and other genital cancers, among them about 70 % of cervical cancers worldwide are only due to HPV strains 16 and 18 (Dunne et al. 2007). For the primary prevention of cervical cancer, HPV vaccines are widely used as an important added tool (Ault et al. 2004; Fife et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2012). Prophylactic and the therapeutic formulation are the two strategies for cervical cancer vaccine candidates. Recently, FDA approved a vaccine named ‘Gardasil 9’ that protects females between the ages of 9–26 against nine HPV strains. More specifically, the first generation of Gardasil vaccine was capable to provide protections against four HPV strains (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18) while the latest approved version of Gardasil vaccine (Gardasil 9) provides protection against five additional high-risk HPV strains (HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-45, HPV-52, and HPV-58) responsible for almost 20 % of cervical cancers worldwide (Braaten and Laufer 2008; Petrosky et al. 2015). Gardasil and Cervarix are prophylactic vaccines and offer no therapeutic benefit for persons already infected with HPV (Wain 2010; Pandhi and Sonthalia 2011). Most of the vaccine candidates that can be used as therapeutic vaccines include immunogenic fragments from early proteins (targets for cellular immunity) for the resolution of precancerous lesions and cervical cancer (Huh and Roden 2008). The protection offered by current vaccines is primarily against HPV types (16 and 18), although cross-protection for other high-risk HPV strains cannot be neglected. The identification of highly conserved cross-clade epitopes suitable for therapeutic intervention is clearly a crucial prerequisite for epitope-based vaccines development and for diagnostic tests to distinguish infection from high or low risk HPV strains. Cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) cross-reactivity is alleged to play an essential role in generating immune responses (Frankild et al. 2008; Petrova et al. 2012). HPV-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes immune responses can be detected in all untreated cervical cancer patients (Eiben et al. 2002; Valdespino et al. 2005). In animal models, cell-mediated immunity is considered to be an important mechanism for abolition of subclinical or neoplasic virus-infected cells, particularly CTL which lyses tumor cells in an antigen-specific manner (Chen et al. 1991; Feltkamp et al. 1993; De Bruijn et al. 1998; Torres-Poveda et al. 2014). Instead of individual epitopes, the use of the full-length protein with a great amount of immunogenic peptides may have a better chance to induce specific CTLs, as shown previously (Strobel et al. 2000; Adams et al. 2003; Bet et al. 2015) but the protection from all high-risk HPV strains from single vaccination will still be a question. Selection of immunogenic consensus conserved epitopes from the proteins of all HPV high-risk strains may provide an experimental basis for designing of universal HPV T-cell vaccines. In the present work, we identified conserved consensus immunogenic CD8+ T-cell epitopes from the proteome of all high-risk HPV strains and proposed a peptide pool with the ability to show immunogenic responses against all the known high-risk HPV strains.\n\nMaterials and methods\nSequence retrieval\nComplete proteome of all the 16 high-risk HPV strains was retrieved from UniProt Knowledgebase (Apweiler et al. 2004). Amino acid sequences of four HPV proteins E1, E2, E6 and E7 were extracted from all the selected proteomes. Subsequently, four sequence datasets were manually prepared for each of the proteins from 16 high-risk HPV strains.\n\nConservancy analysis\nFor conservancy analysis, sequence datasets were first individually aligned using ClustalW software. The substitution model was set to BLOSUM, since the mentioned substitution matrix is based on amino acid pairs in blocks of aligned protein segments, hence performs better in alignments and homology searches compared to those based on accepted mutations in closely related groups (Henikoff and Henikoff 1992). Conservancy of the amino acids of HPV strains among the aligned sequences of datasets was estimated by Shannon entropy function using protein variability server (PVS). Shannon entropy analysis (Shannon 1948) is one of the most sensitive tools to estimate the diversity of a system. For a multiple protein sequence alignment, the Shannon entropy (H) for every position is calculated as follows H=-∑i=1MPilog2Pi where Pi is the fraction of residues of amino acid type i and M is the number of amino acid types.\n\nConsequently, consensus sequences were created for individual conserved fragments within Shannon entropy threshold 2 from corresponding aligned sequence datasets (Gupta et al. 2012). The consensus sequences were further used for the identification of MHC binders.\n\nPrediction of MHC binders\nThe most selective step in the presentation of antigenic peptides to T-cell receptor (TCR) is the binding of the peptide to the MHC molecule (Yewdell and Bennink 1999). NetMHC 3.2 server was used to predict binding of peptides to a number of different HLA alleles using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and weight matrices. Position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs)-based SYFPEITHI (Rammensee et al. 1999) method was employed for the prediction of binding peptides of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. NetMHC 3.2 predicts epitopes with length ranging from 8 to 11 amino acids. Only epitopes with IC50 value below 500 nM were considered as the potential epitopes in ANNs-based prediction from the consensus fragments for four protein datasets. As the epitopes were predicted from the consensus sequences of conserved protein fragments, these epitopes were again realigned with E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins of all high-risk HPV strains. Only those epitopes were kept for subsequent analyses which were 100 % identical to their respective proteins. Further, we performed common allele matrix analysis (Gupta et al. 2010) to discard those epitopes whose allelic response is coverd by more efficient epitopes from the same high-risk HPV strain.\n\nPrediction of non-human homologous immunogenic peptide fragments\nAll the overlapping epitopes (9 mer) were merged to design the potential immunogenic peptide fragments for CD8+ response from each of the protein datasets. A number of immunogenic peptides may fail to raise a T-cell response if they are recognized as self peptides due to significant similarity exists between the antigenic peptides and proteins of host organism. For this, the final sets of potential immunogenic peptide fragments were checked for their similarities with annotated human proteins using offline BLAST similarity search.\n\nPopulation coverage analysis\nPopulation coverage analysis plays a significant role in the epitope-based vaccine designing because of the highly polymorphic nature of the MHC molecules (Reche and Reinherz 2003; Stern and Wiley 1994). Population coverage of newly identified immunogenic peptide fragments were individually analyzed using population coverage tool available at IEDB web server. The tool calculates the response of individuals set of peptide fragments with known MHC- I restrictions on the basis of maximum HLA binding alleles. The average projected population coverage of class I epitopes for the populations distributed in various human populations (ethnicities) was estimated.\n\nResults\nThe E1, E2, E6 and E7 protein sequences from all high-risk HPV strains were collected from UniProtKB and aligned using multiple sequence alignment software clustalW. The multiple alignment files for all the four protein data sets with conserved regions are shown in Supplementary File 1. The conserved fragments within aligned strains of sequence datasets were analyzed by PVS with variability threshold (H) ≤ 2.0. Typically, positions with H ≥ 2.0 are considered variable, whereas those with H ≤ 1 are consider highly conserved (Litwin and Jores 1992). Additionally the positions with H ≤ 2 and H > 1 are also considered as conserved regions (Gupta et al. 2009, 2011). The default cutoff value (H = 1) was too strict, resulting in fewer and smaller targets for the following analysis so the cutoff threshold value was set as 2.0 in the present analysis to identify reasonable conserved fragments with length ≥9 amino acid residues. The consensus sequences of all the conserved regions with length ≥9 amino acids in four datasets of E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins from high-risk HPV strains are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Conserved protein fragments from E1, E2, E6 and E7 protein datasets from all high-risk HPV strains\n\nHPV protein\tConserved fragment number\tStart position\tEnd position\tSequence with nine or more consecutive conserved residues filtered from protein variability server\t\nE1\tE1-1\t2\t12\tMADPEGTDGEG\t\nE1-2\t21\t31\tVEAIVEKKTGD\t\nE1-3\t33\t41\tISDDEDENA\t\nE1-4\t66\t76\tETAQALFNAQE\t\nE1-5\t135\t146\tPDSGYGNTEVET\t\nE1-6\t241\t257\tELVRPFKSDKTTCTDWV\t\nE1-7\t265\t278\tPSVAEGLKTLIKPY\t\nE1-8\t291\t307\tWGVIILMLIRFKCGKNR\t\nE1-9\t312\t321\tKLLSTLLNVP\t\nE1-10\t324\t334\tCMLIEPPKLRS\t\nE1-11\t336\t352\tAAALYWYRTGISNISEV\t\nE1-12\t362\t373\tRQTVLQHSFDDS\t\nE1-13\t375\t388\tFDLSEMVQWAFDND\t\nE1-14\t406\t447\tNSNAAAFLKSNCQAKYVKDCATMCRHYKRAQKRQMSMSQWIK\t\nE1-15\t455\t474\tDGGDWRPIVQFLRYQGVEFI\t\nE1-16\t483\t516\tFLKGTPKKNCIVIYGPANTGKSYFGMSLIHFLQG\t\nE1-17\t535\t545\tDAKIAMLDDAT\t\nE1-18\t555\t572\tYMRNALDGNPISIDRKHR\t\nE1-19\t574\t590\tLVQLKCPPLLITSNINP\t\nE1-20\t595\t606\tRWPYLHSRLTVF\t\nE1-21\t624\t642\tINDKNWKSFFSRTWSRLDL\t\nE1-22\t645\t653\tEEEDKENDG\t\nE2\tE2-1\t7\t26\tMETLSQRLNVCQDKILDHYE\t\nE2-2\t45\t54\tECAIFYKARE\t\nE2-3\t77\t89\tQAIELQMALESLN\t\nE2-4\t110\t118\tTEPKKCFKK\t\nE2-5\t204\t212\tCPESVSSTS\t\nE2-6\t305\t314\tTTPIVHLKGD\t\nE6\tE6-1\t14\t23\tERPRKLHDLC\t\nE6-2\t25\t33\tALETSLHDI\t\nE6-3\t76\t86\tFYSKISEYRHY\t\nE6-4\t113\t127\tCQKPLCPEEKQRHLD\t\nE6-5\t129\t137\tKKRFHNIAG\t\nE7\tE7-1\t6\t15\tPTLQDIVLDL\t\nE7-2\t95\t103\tLQQLLMGTL\t\n\n\nTo generate immunological responses against any pathogen, the binding of antigenic peptide from pathogen and its binding affinity to MHC molecules is one of the crucial steps (Roomp et al. 2010). Using NetMHC 3.2 server, we predicted a total of 65 unique epitopes from the consensus sequences dataset of E1 protein. Likewise, 8 from E2, 5 from E6 and 2 unique epitopes from E7 protein consensus sequence datasets were predicted by the server with either strong or weak binding affinity (Supplementary Table 1–4). As epitopes were predicted from the consensus conserved peptide fragments of protein datasets through NetMHC 3.2 server, there are chances that some of the epitopes may not show 100 % identity with any of the protein in the datasets due to presence of consensus amino acid residues substituted during conservancy analysis. To verify this, epitopes were realigned with the primary protein datasets of E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins collected for various high-risk HPV strains. Those epitopes which were not completely mapped with any of the primary protein sequences of high-risk HPV strains were filtered out. In this process, 16 epitopes from E1, 2 from E2, 2 from E6 and both the epitopes from E7 datasets were discarded. To predict the long immunogenic peptide fragments, all the overlapping epitopes were merged (Table 2). In total, 15 immunogenic conserved peptide fragments were identified, of which 11 fragments were from E1, 3 from E2 and 1 fragment was from E6 protein dataset of high-risk HPV strains.Table 2 Immunogenic peptide fragments identified from selected protein datasets of high-risk HPV strains\n\nHPV protein fragment \tImmunogenic peptide sequence\tHLA alleles targeted\tHigh-risk HPV strains mapped\t\nProtein name\tImmunogenic peptide fragment\t\nE1\tE1-F1\tDSGYGNTEV\tHLA-A6802\t16, 31, 33, 58, 73\t\nE1-F2\tLVRPFKSDK\tHLA-A0301,HLA-A3001\t33, 58\t\nE1-F3\tCMLIEPPKL\tHLA-A0201,HLA-A0211,HLA-A0212,HLA-A0216,HLA-A0219,HLA-A0250\t45, 59\t\nE1-F4\tALYWYRTGISNISEV\tHLA-A0201,HLA-A0202,HLA-A0203,HLA-A0206,HLA-A0211,HLA-A0212,HLA-A0216,HLA-A0250,HLA-A2301,HLA-A2403,HLA-A6802\t16, 18, 39, 45, 68\t\nE1-F5\tDLSEMVQWAFD\tHLA-A0203,HLA-A0211,HLA-A0216,HLA-A0219,HLA-A0250,HLA-B4501\t18, 33, 35\t\nE1-F6\tNSNAAAFLKSNCQAKYVKDCATMCRHYKRAQKRQMSMSQWIK\tHLA-A0201, HLA-A0202,HLA-A0203,HLA-A0206,HLA-A2402,HLA-A3201,HLA-B1501,HLA-B1503,HLA-B2705,HLA-A0301,HLA-A1101,HLA-A6801,HLA-B1503,HLA-A3001,HLA-B0702,HLA-B0801,HLA-B1517,HLA-B5801,HLA-A3101,HLA-A3301,HLA-A2301,HLA-A2403,HLA-A3002,HLA-A6801\t39, 59, 16, 68, 45, 31, 35, 52, 69, 39, 51, 82, 18\t\nE1-F7\tWRPIVQFLRYQGVEFI\tHLA-B2705,HLA-B3501, HLA-B5301,HLA-A0203,HLA-A0206,HLA-A0211,HLA-A0216,HLA-A0250, HLA-B1503\t18, 39, 45, 58, 68, 56, 59\t\nE1-F8\tPKKNCIVIYGPANTGKSYFGMSLIHFL\tHLA-A0201,HLA-A0202,HLA-A0206,HLA-A0211,HLA-A0216,HLA-A6802,HLA-A6901,HLA-B3901,HLA-A2301,HLA-A2402, HLA-A2403,HLA-A2902,HLA-B1501,HLA-A0203,HLA-A3001,HLA-A3201,HLA-B1517,HLA-B5801,HLA-B1503,HLA-A2603,HLA-B1502,HLA-B3501,HLA-B1503\t18, 58, 31, 33, 52, 59, 45, 39\t\nE1-F9\tVQLKCPPLLITSNI\tHLA-B5301,HLA-A0203,HLA-A0201,HLA-A0206,HLA-B1503,HLA-B3901,HLA-B4801\t16, 31, 33, 35, 51\t\nE1-F10\tRWPYLHSRLTVF\tHLA-A0202,HLA-A0203,HLA-A0211,HLA-A0250,HLA-B0801,HLA-B1501,HLA-B1502,HLA-B1503,HLA-B1517,HLA-B3501,HLA-B5401,HLA-A2402,HLA-A2403\t31, 33, 52, 58, 68\t\nE1-F11\tKNWKSFFSRTWSRL\tHLA-A2301,HLA-A2403,HLA-A1101,HLA-A3101,HLA-A3301,HLA-A6801,HLA-B1503,HLA-A3101\t16, 31, 33, 35, 52, 58\t\nE2\tE2-F1\tETLSQRLNVCQDKI\tHLA-A0202,HLA-A0203,HLA-A0212,HLA-A0219,HLA-A6802,HLA-A6901\t16, 31\t\nE2-F2\tECAIFYKAR\tHLA-A6801\t69\t\nE2-F3\tQAIELQMALESL\tHLA-A0202,HLA-A0211,HLA-A0219,HLA-A0250,HLA-B4002,HLA-A0206,HLA-A6802,HLA-A6901,HLA-B3501,HLA-B3901\t39, 59, 68\t\nE6\tE6-F1\tFYSKISEYRHY\tHLA-A2602,HLA-B1503,HLA-B1517,HLA-A2403,HLA-A3101,HLA-A3301,HLA-A6801\t16, 33, 35, 52, 58\t\n\n\nTo further identify the minimal set of immunogenic peptide fragment datasets to target all the high-risk HPV strains, we discarded those peptide fragments where the targeted HLA alleles and high-risk HPV strains were the subsets of other highly efficient peptide fragments shown in Table 2. In this process, immunogenic peptide sequence ECAIFYKAR (Table 2: E2-F2) from the high-risk HPV strain 69 was filtered out as it can be considered the subset of immunogenic fragment E1-F6 which is also present in type 69 HPV strain and also target the same allele besides its affinity with other alleles. Thus, in total, we have identified a peptide pool of 14 sequences that might be effective to generate immunogenic responses against any of the high-risk HPV strains. The interaction map of immunogenic peptide fragments, their HLA allelic responses and their presence in various HPV high-risk strains are shown in Fig. 1. To discard peptide fragments that can be recognized as self protein for the immune system we performed BLAST screening of all the 14 immunogenic peptides with entire human proteome. None of the peptide was similar to human proteome. We finally performed the population coverage analysis of generated immunogenic peptide pool using population coverage analysis tool available at IEDB server (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/population). The percentage population coverage of the immunogenic peptide pool generated from the current analysis in various ethnicities is shown in Table 3.Fig. 1 Illustration of the interaction network of immunogenic peptide fragments, High-risk HPV strains which contributed for the formation of these fragments and MHC class I alleles are shown.

In silico works have attracted considerable attention of experimental biologists for rapid screening and identification of probable vaccine candidates (Sakib et al. 2014; Sharma et al. 2013; Hasan et al. 2013; Oany et al. 2014). The availability of fully sequenced proteome from high-risk HPV strains provide an opportunity for computer-aided screening of reliable peptide-based therapeutic vaccines candidates among billions of possible immune-active peptides.\n\nWe extracted high-risk HPV proteome for 8 HPV specific proteins designated as E- (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6 and E7) or L-type (L1 and L2) according to their expression in early or late differentiation stage of the epithelium (Burd 2003; Rautava and Syrjänen 2012). The early secretary proteins expressed during early differentiating stage of epithelium development in all the 16 high-risk HPV strains. Since the E5 protein of HPV has previously been reported as inducer of down-regulation of MHC class I, we ignored E5 protein in the current analysis. Moreover, E2–E5 region has been shown to be lost when the episomal HPV DNA integrates into host chromosome; using E2–E5 proteins as vaccine candidates may be futile. However, since E1 and E2 are expressed in higher levels than E6 and E7 early in the progress of an HPV infection, it may be assumed that these proteins may considered as good targets for vaccine designing to treat early stages of disease (Burd 2003). Therefore, E2 protein was included for epitope-based vaccine designing in the present study along with E1, E6 and E7 protein. Based on our computational workflow, we generated a pool of 14 peptide fragments with length varying from 9 to 43 amino acid residues to provide immunogenic responses against all the high-risk HPV strains. The hallmark of the immune system is its ability to recognize and distinguish between self and non-self. T-cells do this task by recognizing peptides that are bound to MHC receptors. Epitopes are usually thought to be derived from non-self protein antigen that interacts with antibodies or T-cell receptors, thereby activating an immune response. Epitopes are usually thought to be derived from non-self protein antigen that interacts with antibodies or T-cell receptors, thereby activating an immune response. Also the antigen–antibody interaction is reversible, therefore, weak interactions often lead to cross-reactivity of antigens. The main reasons of cross-reactivity are either the homologous proteins that are conserved throughout the development and expressed by both the infectious agent and the host or the viral proteins that share short regions of amino acid sequence similarity with a non-homologous host protein. Therefore, to exclude the epitopes those are conserved between the pathogen and the host, we performed sequence alignment of the selected pool of 14 immunogenic peptides with entire human proteome. We did not observe similarity between any of the selected immunogenic peptide fragments with human proteome, we also discarded epitopes showing weak interactions with HLA alleles. Thus we believe that all the 14 sequences together will form the best peptide pool to generated immunogenic responses against any of the high-risk HPV strains infection.\n\nPopulation coverage analysis for a given set of immunogenic peptides is important to determine their efficacy as the frequency of expression of their targeted HLA alleles varies across ethnicities. With the population coverage analysis, we concluded that least immunogenic response is shown by HPV strain 73 followed by strain 56 in almost all the ethnicities. Thus, the data indicate that the generated peptide fragments pool will provide very weak protection against HPV Type 73 and 56. The best response is shown by North American population for all the HPV high-risk strains based on the HLA alleles frequency data. Overall, we proposed the pool of 14 immunogenic peptide fragments with length ranging from 9 to 43 amino acid residues to provide the protection against all the HPV high-risk strains except Type 73 and 56 in all the ethnicities.\n\nConclusion\nImmunoinformatics has changed the paradigm of ancient vaccinology since it is recently emerged as a critical field for accelerating immunology research (Baloria et al. 2012). Moreover, the immunoinformatics techniques applied to T-cells have advanced to a greater degree than those dealing with B-cells. Indeed, it is now a common practice to identify the vaccine candidates using in silico approaches before being subjected to in vitro confirmatory studies (Gupta et al. 2009; Ranjbar et al. 2015). The major objective of our study was to identify an immunogenic peptide pool containing epitopes that can be effective against all the high-risk HPV strains circulating globally. Some cross-protections were already observed in case of previously identified vaccines. Such as, Cervarix vaccine which was initially designed by targeting HPV 16 and 18 strains but later found to provide additional cross-protections against HPV 31, 33 and 45 strains. However, most of the high-risk HPV strains were evolved by accumulating random mutations in the epitopes recognizing regions and therefore many of the high-risk strains are not effectively targeted by available HPV vaccines. Therefore, we used the consensus epitopes extracted from highly conserved regions of E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins from all the high-risk HPV strains identified so far. The vaccine formulated by the proposed peptide pool can alert the body’s immune system to generate immunization memory cells upon injecting. Subsequently, as these are MHC class I epitopes, the proteasomal degradation machineries can degrade the whole vaccine and release these conserved epitopes in host. Furthermore, because of the conserved nature of the epitopes the immune system will be trained to recognize these epitopes in case of HPV infection by any high-risk strains and thus can provide the cross-protection. Using the computational workflow presented in this manuscript, we identified 14 conserved immunogenic peptide fragments from 4 early proteins (E1, E2, E6 and E7) of 16 high-risk HPV types providing CD8+ responses which can be validated experimentally for the designing of an universal vaccine against all the high-risk HPV strains.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOCX 36 kb)\n\n Supplementary material 2 (DOCX 16 kb)\n\n Supplementary material 3 (DOCX 15 kb)\n\n Supplementary material 4 (DOCX 14 kb)\n\n Supplementary material 5 (DOCX 35 kb)\n\n \n\nAbbreviations\nHPVHuman papilloma virus\n\nCTLCytotoxic T-cell\n\nPVSProtein variability server\n\nMHCMajor histocompatibility complex\n\nTCRT-cell receptor\n\nHLAHuman leukocyte antigen\n\nPSSMsPosition specific scoring matrices\n\nANNArtificial neural network\n\nKrishna P.

Several proangiogenic molecules have been reported to be associated in CML progression, including the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). However, detail mechanism about the cellular distribution and function of HGF in CML is yet to be revealed. The proliferation of hematopoietic cells are regulated by some of the growth factors like interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL-6, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, etc. In this study IL-6 pathways have been taken into consideration which induces JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways to decipher the CML progression stages. An attempt has been made to model these pathways with the help of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and estimating unknown parameters through fminsearch optimization algorithm. Some of the specific component like STAT3, of the pathway has been analyzed in detail and their role in CML progression has been elucidated. The roles of STAT3 inhibitors into the treatment of CML have been thoroughly studied and optimum concentration of the inhibitors have been predicted.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-015-0357-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nHGFIL6ODE’sJAK/STAT and MAPK pathwaysissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nChronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a stem cell disorder resulted by abnormal growth of granulocytes (Strife and Clarkson 1988). The CML progression can be further differentiated into three phases namely Chronic, \nAccelerated and Blast depending on its severity, respectively (Kantarjian et al. 2006). The occurrence of CML has been reported to increase in two folds during last decade (An et al. 2010). It has been further reported that, translocation of the ABL gene on chromosome 9th to BCR gene on chromosome 22nd results into a hybrid Philadelphia chromosome with chimeric BCR-ABL genes (Daley et al. 1990; Rowley 1973; Ye et al. 2014). These chimeric genes encode BCR-ABL oncoproteins which contains the activated tyrosine kinase region of ABL, causing aberrant tyrosine kinase activity and hence promotes the proliferation of CML cells (National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, v2, 2009). The constitutive proliferations of BCR-ABL genes and their aberrant expressions lead to several abnormalities in the peripheral blood and bone marrow which consequently alters the number of granular leukocytes (Daley et al. 1990; Baccarani et al. 2006; Cerny-Reiterer et al. 2012). It is being reported that the earlier treatments processes involving chemotherapy, bone marrow and stem cell transplantation are often associated with serious side effects (Baccarani et al. 2006). Nowadays, CML is being treated by the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which leads to the increased rate of patient survivability. Most of inhibitors target the inhibition of ATP binding process with tyrosine kinase domain of ABL protein (Cerny-Reiterer et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2010). The breakthrough treatment for CML was reported with the discovery of Imatinib (Savage and Antman 2002; Pray 2008). However, the reoccurrence of the CML cases in Imatinib treated patients has been reported due to the point mutation of amino acid residues in BCR-ABL receptors active site. Although few other receptors like STAT3, STAT5, and SRC have also been investigated as alternative to overcome the Imatinib resistance. In this study STAT3 receptor protein has been taken into consideration to explore the CML associated biochemical pathways like IL-6, which induces the MAPK and JAK-STAT (Reynaud et al. 2011; Bhalla and Iyengar 1999). IL-6 is an interleukin which is encoded by the IL-6 gene and responsible for pro-inflammatory cytokine and anti-inflammatory myokine activity. In overall IL-6, JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways, common gp130 (glycoprotein 130) binds to the plasma membrane receptor complex. Signal transduction activates the JAK tyrosine kinase family members, which activates the transcription factors of the STAT (Peifer et al. 2014). The interlinked pathway for IL-6-type cytokines is the MAPK pathway. Schematic representation of whole IL-6 associated signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 1. It has been reported that activation of STAT3 by bone marrow cells protects the CML from tyrosine kinase mediated inhibition of BCR-ABL protein. So, targeting the STAT3 in addition to BCR-ABL would enhance CML cells with kinase-independent resistance to TKI therapy. Recent study has reported BP-5-087 molecule as a multi-target inhibitor for BCR-ABL and STAT3 receptor. Further it was found that BP-5-087 molecule act on the Imatinib resistant cells and reduced the CML progression significantly (Eiring et al. 2015).Fig. 1 Schematic representation of JAK/STAT and MAPK Pathway, blue color indicates the common IL-6 pathway, red indicates the JAK/STAT, Green indicates the MAPK pathway, and Magenta indicates the nucleolar components\n\n\n\nMethods\nThe entire experiments were performed on Centos 6.5 of Linux operating systems with 12 GB RAM, NVIDIA graphics and 1 TB Hard disk computer system. Hardware of the system was as follows: Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40 GHz processor.\n\nModel description\nCML associated signaling pathway in which IL-6 induces the two pathways, i.e. JAK/STAT and MAPK have been taken as model pathways. IL-6 is the first component of the said pathway, which enters into the cell by cell membrane and activates the entire pathway. In this process, IL-6 binds to the protein gp80, which is not involved in signaling process of the protein. The receptor gp130 which is a part of the signaling process attaches to the tyrosine kinases of JAK. Then IL-6-gp80 complex reacts to the compound gp130-JAK to form the complex IL6- gp80- gp130- JAK. Formation of this complex results in the dime formation of the complex IL6- gp80- gp130- JAK to form (IL6- gp80- gp130- JAK)2 (Heinrich et al. 2003). SHP-2 binds to the phosphorylated dimer complex (IL6-gp80-gp130-JAK)2 to form (IL6-gp80-gp130-JAK)*2-SHP-2 complex which act as the point of initiation for both the MAPK and JAK-STAT pathway (Yamada et al. 2003). In JAK-STAT signaling process, phosphorylated dimer (IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 recruits the transcription factor STAT3. The phosphorylation of the component STAT3 leads to its dissociation from the (IL6-gp80-gp130-JAK)2 complex and further undergo the process of dimerization. The dimerized complex of the STAT3 enters into the nucleus to undergo dephosphorylation and transferred back again into the cytosol for the another cycle of (Heinrich et al. 2003).\n\nIt has been reported that apart from BCR-ABL, STAT3 receptor also plays major role in CML progression which is an important component in JAK/STAT pathway. We assumed the initial concentration of STAT3 in the pathway to be 1 nM as earlier reported (Charusanti et al. 2004). From the literature, it is been reported that BP-5-087 can inhibit the activity of STAT3 by 70 %, therefore we took the inhibited (treated) concentration of STAT3 as 0.3 nM (Eiring et al. 2015). JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway is regulated by the two phosphatases of STAT3 namely PP1 and PP2. Theses phosphatases enhance the activation of STAT3 component in nucleolus and cytosol both. The phosphatase PP2 present in the nucleus is a very important part of JAK-STAT since it is responsible in deactivating the phosphorylated dimer complex of STAT3 in the nucleus. This process of deactivation, play a crucial role for coming back of STAT3 to the cytosol so that it can undergo another cycle of phosphorylation–dephosphorylation. Binding of SHP-2 to the complex (IL6- gp80-gp130-JAK)*2 plays a major role in linking JAK-STAT to the MAPK pathway. This process of complex formation is an important process for the MAPK signaling pathway.\n\nKinetics of biochemical reactions\nSchematic representation of chemical process of the pathway is shown in Fig. 1. The whole chemical processes in the pathway are decomposed into elementary reactions. This reaction model contains 67 state variables and 111 unknown rate constants. It has been assumed that initial concentration of each component is 1 nM and experimental concentrations are taken from reported literature (Charusanti et al. 2004). The kinetic reactions of the pathway are provided in Appendix I (Online Supplementary Material).\n\nMathematical modeling of JAK/STAT and MAPK pathway\nIn this work, model parameters were calculated from the experimental data obtained from IL-6 induced signaling pathways. Systems biology techniques were used to understand various components involved in reaction mechanism of this pathway and to predict the behavior of individual reaction components (Heinrich et al. 2002; Papin et al. 2005; Tyson et al. 2003; Ge et al. 2013). Deterministic rate laws have been used to simulate various chemical and biochemical reactions (Edda et al. 2006; Tian and Song 2012; Klipp and Liebermeister 2006). The deterministic mathematical modeling of chemical network works on the basis of law of mass action and Michaelis–Menten reaction kinetics (Kanodia and Finn 2014). It has been further reported that the prior information of initial concentration, law of mass action etc., can enable the simulation of time series data to study substrate concentration and its temporal behavior (Edda et al. 2006; Tian and Song 2012). However, simulation process provides in depth understanding of each components of the biological systems and its activities in different environmental conditions (Gilbert et al. 2006; Guerriero et al. 2009). The rate of change in substrate concentration over a given period of time can be utilized to find the crucial parameters involved in the reaction mechanism (Salis and Kaznessis 2005). IL-6 induced signaling pathway has been simulated through deterministic mathematical modeling (Kwiatkowska et al. 2006). The candidate reaction pathways were simulated through ordinary differentiation equations to get the individual rate constant parameters (Deng and Tian 2014; Liepe et al. 2014). The parametric optimization was performed by “fminsearch” algorithm on MATLAB R2012a. Complete methodology has been shown in Fig. 2Fig. 2 Flow chart of the adopted methodology\n\n\n\nIn this process IL-6 induces two pathways like JAK/STAT and MAPK pathway which are responsible for various cellular processes.\n\nParameter estimation\nThe parameters associated with above stated JAK/STAT and MAPK pathway’s reactions are estimated through ODE solver. This numerical simulation of model was performed by using MATLAB ODE solver toolbox (Bogacki and Shampine 1989). The standard ODE solver ODE45 was used to construct and solve the differential equations based on Runge–Kutta approximation method. Runge–Kutta methods involves implicit and explicit iterative methods for temporal discretization and approximation of ODE solutions. The proposed models with continuous states were being iterated and further optimized by fminsearch. 1 [t,x]=ode45(@function, tspan,x0) where ‘@function’ is the vector of function handles, ‘tspan’ a vector specifying the time span of simulation and ‘x0’ is the state variables of differential equations. The ‘tspan’ and ‘x0’ represents the specific time interval and initial starting conditions, respectively.\n\nParameter optimization\nfminsearch is a MATLAB function which minimize the error function with multiple variables, with the assigned estimated values of state variables. It utilizes nonlinear unconstrained multivariable optimization problems based on Nelder–Mead Sequential Simplex (NMSS) algorithm (Andrews and Larry 1992; Lagarias et al. 1998).\n\nWith the multiple functions are f(x1), f(x2)… f(xn + 1) the Nelder Mead Algorithm. NMSS is a nonlinear optimization technique, which is used to solve numerical problems with unknown derivatives. However, NMSS is a heuristic search method that can converge to non-stationary points (Powell 1973). 2 x=fminsearch(@function,x0) where function is an M-file function such as 3 functionf=function(x)  4 f=fminsearch(@minimize,x0) whereas, @minimize is a function containing objective function.\n\nError function used for minimizing scalar function is: 5 Error=∑(Simulated\\,result-Experimental\\,data)2 \n\nExperimental data\nExperimental concentrations of the each substrate have been taken from (Singh et al. 2006) study. All the experimental values are shown in Appendix 1 (Online Supplementary Material) which is required for the modeling and simulation.\n\nResults and discussion\nIt has been reported that CML exhibit an aberrant expression of beta lymphoid cells which are directly influenced with cytokine IL-6 pathway, which involves two significant pathways like JAK/STAT and MAPK pathway. To get insight of the molecular mechanism of the CML, extensive in silico study of both pathways are needed. Aberrant expression of STAT3 in the IL-6 signaling pathway had been proven as prime cause of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). It has been established that STAT3 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CML because it is an important component of the JAK/STAT pathway. Alteration or inhibition of STAT3 concentration indirectly influence the another associated MAPK pathway.\n\nMathematical model of the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathway\nThese two interlinked pathways consist of 67 biochemical reactions and their 111 unknown rate constants. These biochemical reactions involve mass-action kinetic and Michaelis–menten kinetic reactions. All these reactions of the MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways were mathematically modeled in the form of ordinary differential equations. In continuation, all differential equations were solved by ode45 solver in MATLAB.\n\nODE models of the said chemical reactions are given in Supplementary material 3.\n\nIn this work role of STAT3 has been analyzed, as STAT3 is the most significant component of JAK/STAT pathway. STAT3 combines with (IL6- gp80- gp130-JAK) complex and form another complex, i.e. (IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)-STAT3. STAT3 activates the (IL6- gp80- gp130-JAK) complex to enter into the MAPK pathway by dissociating themselves before the entry. By analyzing complete pathway of JAK/STAT and MAPK one can infer that STAT3 plays a decisive role into CML associated pathway.\n\nParameter estimation\nExperimental concentrations of the substrates involved in IL-6 induced signaling pathway are shown in Appendix I (Online Supplementary Material), Whereas ode45 solves the differential equation, fminsearch minimizes the error function and finds the optimized values of rate constants kfi, kri, kmi and, kvi. The simulation was initiated by considering unit value, i.e. 1 nM of each component of the reaction for a period of 32 min. After selection of random time intervals, 0–32 min gives the most closure value to the reported one. The results of simulation and values of unknown optimized rate constants are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Estimated parameter values of the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways\n\nParameter\tValues\tParameter\tValues\tParameter\tValues\t\n\nkf1\n\t1.103424\t\nkr23\n\t1.106123\t\nkf45\n\t1.062902\t\n\nkr1\n\t0.947931\t\nk24\n\t1.012899\t\nkr45\n\t0.966483\t\n\nkf2\n\t1.035664\t\nk25a\n\t0.925016\t\nkf46\n\t1.021281\t\n\nkr2\n\t1.088271\t\nk25b\n\t0.964434\t\nkr46\n\t1.136333\t\n\nkf3\n\t0.967368\t\nk26\n\t1.011042\t\nkf47\n\t0.984223\t\n\nkr3\n\t0.861028\t\nk27\n\t0.962845\t\nkr47\n\t1.014038\t\n\nkf4\n\t1.035329\t\nkf28\n\t0.91007\t\nkf48\n\t1.009415\t\n\nkr4\n\t0.820722\t\nkr28\n\t0.959089\t\nkr48\n\t1.115897\t\n\nk5\n\t1.028834\t\nk29\n\t1.027849\t\nkf49\n\t1.075979\t\n\nkf6\n\t0.976114\t\nk30\n\t1.027844\t\nkr49\n\t0.945278\t\n\nkr6\n\t0.958236\t\nk31\n\t1.210422\t\nkf50\n\t1.096496\t\n\nk7\n\t1.022409\t\nkf32\n\t1.045764\t\nkr50\n\t0.981725\t\n\nkf8\n\t0.977993\t\nkr32\n\t0.93087\t\nk51\n\t1.043507\t\n\nkr8\n\t1.069307\t\nkf33\n\t1.04418\t\nkf52\n\t−0.30235\t\n\nkf9\n\t0.984565\t\nkr33\n\t0.901555\t\nkr52\n\t1.017269\t\n\nkr9\n\t1.056293\t\nkf34\n\t1.049215\t\nk53\n\t0.983402\t\n\nkf10\n\t1.009209\t\nkr34\n\t0.959882\t\nkf54\n\t1.000033\t\n\nkr10\n\t1.0096\t\nkf35\n\t0.99873\t\nkr54\n\t0.944497\t\n\nk11\n\t1.011066\t\nkr35\n\t0.959118\t\nk55\n\t1.216468\t\n\nkf12\n\t1.095124\t\nkf36\n\t0.976274\t\nkf56\n\t0.993236\t\n\nkr12\n\t0.975454\t\nkr36\n\t0.948192\t\nkr56\n\t1.059524\t\n\nk13\n\t0.96618\t\nkf37\n\t1.049747\t\nk57\n\t1.034902\t\n\nkf14\n\t1.008209\t\nkr37\n\t0.870539\t\nkf58\n\t1.056031\t\n\nkr14\n\t1.070989\t\nkf38\n\t0.978582\t\nkr58\n\t1.026759\t\n\nk15\n\t1.123849\t\nkr38\n\t1.011961\t\nk59\n\t1.062045\t\n\nkf16\n\t1.020288\t\nkf39\n\t1.028694\t\nkf60\n\t0.993215\t\n\nkr16\n\t0.959555\t\nkr39\n\t1.021497\t\nkr60\n\t0.953189\t\n\nk17\n\t1.010703\t\nkf40\n\t0.932659\t\nk61\n\t0.951944\t\n\nkf18\n\t1.001588\t\nkr40\n\t1.023355\t\nkf62\n\t1.012305\t\n\nkr18\n\t1.006706\t\nkf41\n\t0.96972\t\nkr62\n\t0.92763\t\n\nkf19\n\t1.217099\t\nkr41\n\t1.06176\t\nk63\n\t0.966868\t\n\nkr19\n\t1.002411\t\nkf42\n\t0.993106\t\nkf64\n\t1.024082\t\n\nk20\n\t1.168012\t\nkr42\n\t1.000562\t\nkr64\n\t1.002367\t\n\nkf21\n\t0.986824\t\nkf43\n\t1.010405\t\nk65\n\t0.965469\t\n\nkr21\n\t1.034464\t\nkr43\n\t1.083823\t\nkf66\n\t1.002329\t\n\nk22\n\t1.040881\t\nVm\n\t0.991752\t\nkr66\n\t1.061648\t\n\nkf23\n\t1.0146\t\nKm\n\t1.045753\t\nk67\n\t0.972167\t\n\n\nModel simulation\nThe mathematical model of 67 state variables has been simulated with respect to time for a period of 32 min to understand the behavioral changes of the various components involved in the signaling pathway.

Inhibition of STAT3 leads to decrease in the concentration of STAT3 complexes, such as (IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 -STAT3C, STAT3C*, (IL6- gp80- gp130- JAK)*2- STAT3C* and STAT3C*-STAT3C* as compared to the normal condition. Phosphorylation of STAT3 is essential for the signaling through JAK-STAT. These complexes help in the phosphorylation and transportation to the nucleus. If the STAT3 is inhibited, then it cannot be phosphorylated and consequently the JAK/STAT pathway will be inhibited.Fig. 3 \na\nBlue color (upper) indicates the normal cancerous cells and green (lower) treated cells, Plot of [(IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 -STAT3C] vs time. b\nBlue color (upper) indicates the normal cancerous cells and green (lower) treated cells, Plot of [STAT3C*] vs time\n\nFig. 4 \na\nBlue color (upper) indicates the normal cancerous cells and green (lower) treated cells, Plot of [(IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 -STAT3C*] vs time. b\nBlue color (upper) indicates the normal cancerous cells and green (lower) treated cells, Plot of [STAT3C*-STAT3C*] vs time\n\n\n\n(IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 –SHP2 acts as an interlinker between MAPK and JAK/STAT pathway. SHP-2 plays a crucial role in interlinking the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways. Inhibition of STAT3 also affects the SHP-2 component. After binding of SHP-2 to (IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 complex, the level of (IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 –SHP2 got reduced.\n\nSHP-2 and its complexes\nFigure 5a, b represents the concentration of complex (IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 –SHP2 in normal and treated condition. If the STAT3 component is inhibited, the level of (IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 –SHP2 complex will be reduced and will indeed affect the initiation of MAPK pathway and the JAK/STAT pathway. Reduction in the concentration of (IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 –SHP2 complex due to STAT3 inhibition, also affects the phosphorylated complex, (IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 –SHP2* and the SHP-2* component. These phosphorylated events form an important part of the MAPK pathway. Figure 6a represents the normal and treated condition of, (IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 –SHP2* and SHP-2* which shows the decrease in the level of concentration as compared to the normal condition and hampering the MAPK pathway.Fig. 5 \na\nBlue color (upper) indicates the normal cancerous cells and green (lower) treated cells, Plot of [(IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 –SHP2] vs time. b\nBlue color (upper) indicates the normal cancerous cells and green (lower) treated cells, Plot of [(IL6-gp80- gp130-JAK)*2 –SHP2*] vs time\n\nFig. 6 \na\nBlue color (upper) indicates the normal cancerous cells and green (lower) treated cells, Plot of [SHP-2*] vs time. b\nBlue color (upper) indicates the normal cancerous cells and green (lower) treated cells, Plot of [PP1-STAT3C*] vs time\n\n\n\nPP1 and PP2 complexes\nJAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is regulated by the two STAT3 phosphatases, PP1 and PP2. Theses phosphates influence the activation of STAT component in both the cytosol and the nucleus. Figures 6b and 7a represents the normal and treated condition of the PP1 complex, PP1-STAT3C* and PP1-STAT3C*- STAT3C*. Inhibition of STAT3 also influences. Inhibition of STAT3 component affects the PP1 and due to which the concentration of PP1 complexes are also reduced. If PP1 is affected, it will hamper the activation of STAT component then further the JAK/STAT pathway. Along with STAT3, PP2 also plays a crucial role in JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Figure 7b represents the behavior of PP2 with respect to time when the STAT3 is in normal and treated condition. It can be analyzed that level of PP2 in treated condition is reaching to the lower level as compared the normal condition at the end of the simulation. This shows that STAT3 is affecting the levels of PP2 in the pathway. PP2 deactivates the phosphorylated STAT3 dimer STAT3 N- STAT3 N* in the nucleus. This deactivation of STAT3 is necessary for the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle of STAT3 in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. If the STAT3 is inhibited, the level of PP2 will be decreased and it will not be able to deactivate the phosphorylated STAT3 dimer in the nucleus. This condition will affect the concentration of STAT3 in cytoplasm and STAT3 N*- STAT3 N* in the nucleus and will further reduce the efficiency of signaling process through JAK-STAT pathway and other cellular processes.Fig. 7 \na\nBlue color (upper) indicates the normal cancerous cells and green (lower) treated cells, Plot of [PP1-STAT3C*- STAT3C*] vs time. b\nBlue\ncolor (upper) indicates the normal cancerous cells and green (lower) indicates the treated cells, Plot of [PP2] vs time\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this work, mathematical models of all biochemical reactions of CML associated signaling pathways like JAK/STAT and MAPK have been generated. An attempt has been made to investigate the effect of inhibitors on particular receptor like STAT3 receptor in CML associated signaling pathways. Each step of pathways was converted into respective biochemical kinetics following mass action principle of michaelis–menten kinetic reactions. We proposed an effective optimization approach for estimating model parameters of the JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling pathways. Fminsearch function was used to minimize the error during simulation process. It generates observation data at different time interval together with the first order derivatives of the model parameters. The calculated parameters values were used to infer unknown parameters. Simulation results suggested that the proposed optimization method is effective, robust and reliable parameter estimation technique. Further the role of STAT3 has also been predicted in CML associated signaling pathways. Since the phosphorylation of STAT3 is crucial for signaling process of JAK/STAT and MAPK pathway, hence its inhibition affects other components of the pathways such as PP1, PP2, and SHP2. Inhibitory effect of the BP-5-087 ligand on STAT3 receptor was compared with the normal (untreated condition). It can be inferred from the simulation results that BP-5-087 can successfully reduce the progression of CML which is further in concurrence with the earlier reported in vitro study by Eiring et al. (2015). The proposed model may be utilized to analyze an overall impact of various inhibitors targeting the CML associated receptor proteins.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOC 114 kb)\n\n \n\nThe authors are thankful to the Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad for providing all computational facility to complete this work.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors are declared that, there is no conflict of interest.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAn X  Tiwari AK  Sun Y  Ding PR  Ashby CR  Chen ZS   BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia: a review Leuk Res 2010 34 10 1255 1268 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.04.016 20537386 \nAndrews, Larry C.

Mass production of microalgal oil faces a number of technical barriers that make the current production of biodiesel economically unfeasible. Small size (≈1–20 μm) and negatively charged surface of the microalgal cells pose difficulties in the process of harvesting. This leads to significant increase in the overall cost of biomass production. The present study explored different methods and conditions for harvesting of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803. A customized air-lift reactor was used for the cultivation of biomass under photoautotrophic condition. Significant improvement in the rate of productivity of biomass was observed. Maximum biomass productivity of 0.25, 0.14 g L−1 d−1 for Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803, respectively, were obtained. Various flocculation techniques viz. auto-flocculation, inorganic, chitosan and electrolytic flocculation were used for the recovery of biomass. Among all the techniques, electro-flocculation showed high flocculation efficiency (98 %) and floatation of floc causing easy harvesting. Moreover, low-cost and easy control of the process justify electro-flocculation as a most suitable and promising technique for the recovery of microalgal cells.\n\nKeywords\nHarvestingFlocculation efficiencyChitosanElectrolytic coagulation-floatationChlorella sp.

Algal cultivation requires minimum nutritional input. They may be used for wastewater bioremediation. The biomass generated from such processes can be used for production of third generation of biofuels like biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen, biobutanol, and other biofuels (Skjanes et al. 2007; Nayak et al. 2013). For the commercialization of bioproducts from microalgae, a large amount of algal biomass is required. Harvesting plays a significant role in product development which separates the microalgal biomass from their liquid media. Development of cost-effective and environment-friendly methods for harvesting of algal biomass are still challenging for the future. Separation of algae is difficult mainly due to smaller particle size (1–20 μm), low cell density and low specific gravity of algal (Ghernaout and Ghernaout 2012). Several species of microalgae have different characteristics such as size, shape, and motility. These can influence their behavior towards flocculation techniques unlike other non-living particles in suspension (Vlaski et al. 1997). Most of the commercial organizations use centrifugation, the traditional method of harvesting. But it is an energy intensive process since it consumes a good amount of electric power (Chen et al. 2011). Some microalgae can be harvested using filtration, but membrane fouling limits the process due to clogging of the pore by extracellular organic matter (Wu et al. 2012). It can also be harvested using foam fractionation, but the energy consumption for large-scale harvesting systems is high. If algae oil is to be a viable future energy source, the harvesting problem will need to be overcome. So, development of an efficient harvesting strategy is a major challenge in the commercialization of products from microalgae. This step accounts for 20–30 % of the total cost of production (Grima et al. 2003). A suitable approach to harvesting is needed to minimize the cost, energy consumption and applicable for a wider range of conditions.\n\n\nThe harvesting of microalgae by flocculating agents has been found more promising over other methods. It allows to flocculate a large quantity of microalgal cultures and applies to a broad range of species (Uduman et al. 2010). The lower energy consumption and costs render it as an attractive technique. Microalgal cell suspensions are stabilized by the surface charge of the cells. Microalgal cells carry a negative charge that prevents aggregation of cells in suspension (Nishifi et al. 2011). Various flocculation methods are used to destabilize the cell suspension. The addition of flocculants destabilizes the cell suspension for the creation of aggregates of microalgal cells. The surface charge can be neutralized or reduced by adding flocculants such as multivalent cations and cationic polymers to the broth. The increase in effective particle size of the cell leads to sedimentation and hence microalgal biomass can be recovered. Moreover, an inexpensive and nontoxic flocculation method is desired which would be effective in low concentration (Milledge and Heaven 2013). The flocculation efficiency varies with different flocculating agents, microalgal species and culture conditions (Henderson et al. 2008). The flocculation efficiency mainly depends on an electric neutralization effect after hydrolysis of the coagulant and emerging compression of the electrical double layer. This leads to the formation of the adsorbent bridges resulting in a macromolecular complex.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to increase biomass production and identification of suitable method for harvesting of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 (lipid rich) and Synechocystis PCC 6803. Different flocculating methods such as inorganic flocculants alum and FeCl3, bio-flocculant like chitosan, auto-flocculation, and electrolytic coagulation-flocculation were evaluated to recover the microalgal biomass from diluted suspension.\n\nMaterials and methods\nCultivation of microalgae\n\nMicroalgae species namely, Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 were obtained from the culture collection of algae at IARI, New Delhi, India and Uppsala University, Sweden, respectively. Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 were grown in a customized airlift reactor (1.4 L) under 120 µmol m−2 s−1 light intensity. The light intensity was measured using a quantum sensor (LI-COR, Model LI-190SA, NE, USA) and the light meter (LI-COR, Model LI-250A, NE, USA). TAP minus acetate medium was selected as the growth medium for Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and BG11 for Synechocystis PCC 6803. The composition of TAP minus acetate media contained 2.42 g L−1 Tris base, 25 mL L−1 TAP salt stock solution (15.0 g L−1 NH4Cl, 4.0 g L−1 MgSO4·7H2O, 2.0 g L−1 CaCl2·2H2O, 0.375 ml L−1 PO4 stock solution (28.8 g per 100 mL K2HPO4, 14.4 g per 100 mL KH2PO4), 1 ml L−1 Hutner trace metals (21.6 g per 100 mL H2O EDTA: Titriplex II, 11 g per 50 mL H2O ZnSO4·7H2O, 5.7 g per 100 mL H2O H3BO3, 2.53 g per 25 mL H2O MnCl2 × 4H2O, 0.805 g per 25 mL H2O CoCl2·6H2O,0.785 g per 25 mL H2O CuSO4·5H2O, 0.55 g per 25 mL H2O (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 2.495 g per 25 mL H2O FeSO4·7H2O), 1 ml L−1 vitamins stock solution (0.5 mg L−1 cyanocobalamin (B12), 100 mg L−1 thiamine HCl, 0.5 mg L−1 Biotin), glacial acetic acid was absent in TAP [-acetate] medium. Initial pH of the medium was set at 7.2. 1 L of BG-11 medium contained 0.04 g of K2HPO4, 0.075 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.036 g of CaCl2·2H2O, 6.0 mg of citric acid, 6.0 mg of ferric ammonium citrate, 1.0 mg of Na2EDTA, 0.02 g of Na2CO3 and 1.0 mL of trace metal solution A5. 1 L of the trace metal solution A5 contained 2.86 g of H3BO3, 1.81 g MnCl2·4H2O, 0.22 g ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.39 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.079 g of CuSO4·5H2O and 49.4 mg of Co (NO3)2·6H2O. The biomass harvesting experiments were carried out at the stationary phase of growth at room temperature.\n\nAir-lift photobioreactor\n\nAir-lift photobioreactor was made up of plexiglass of thickness 5 mm. Air-lift bioreactors were of dimensions diameter 7 × 42.3 cm with two sides opening near the top and bottom of the reactor. The diameter of the draft tube of an air-lift reactor was 3 cm. The surface by volume (S/V) ratio and the Ad/Ar were 0.57 cm−1 and 4.4, respectively where, Ad and Ar are the area of downcomer and riser, respectively. Airstream was provided by a sparger attached at the bottom (Fig. 1a, b). Photobioreactors were constantly illuminated by tube light at a light intensity of 120 μmol m−2 s−1.Fig. 1 \na Schematic diagram of an air-lift reactor, b experimental setup of air-lift reactor\n\n\n\nDetermination of cell concentration\nThe biomass concentrations (dry cell weight, g/L) of microalgae were calculated from measurements of the optical density (OD) of cultures at 750 nm according to the following equations: Synechocystis PCC 6803, y = 0.499x + 0.125, R2 = 0.967, Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11: y = 0.420x + 0.166, R2 = 0.954. To obtain the same concentration of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 broth culture was concentrated by centrifugation (Eppendorf, Hamburg) at 4000 rpm for 5 min and diluted by their respective supernatant according to need and equalized the OD at 750 nm. The pH values were monitored using a desktop pH meter (Orion 5 stars, Thermo Scientific).\n\nDetermination of volumetric biomass productivity\nVolumetric biomass productivity was calculated by following equation. BiomassproductivitygL-1d-1=X2-X1t2-t1 where, X1 and X2 are biomass concentrations (g/L) at time t1 and t2.\n\nDetermination of flocculation efficiency\nThe optical density of the supernatant was measured from the middle of the height of the clarified layer (Nova Spectro, Amersham pharmacia biotech). The flocculation efficiency was calculated according to equation. Flocculationefficiency=ODi-ODf/ODi×100 where ODi = Initial OD and ODf = final OD at 750 nm.\n\nStock preparation of flocculants\n200 mg of ferric chloride, alum and chitosan were weighed (Sartorius) individually and dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water to obtain 10 mg/ml of individual stock. Chitosan (Sigma-Aldrich) solution was made in 1 % acetic acid solution according to Divakaran and Pillai (2002).\n\nExperimental setup for chemical flocculation\nAuto-flocculation of Chlorella MJ 11/11 was studied by taking a pH range of 8–12.5. The pH of the TAP minus acetate medium was adjusted by adding 1 M NaOH and 1 M HCl. Various concentration of ferric chloride (100–400 mg/L), potassium aluminum sulfate (100–500 mg/L), chitosan (5–25 mg/L) solution were added and mixed properly. It was kept undisturbed for settling. The Supernatant was collected from the middle of beaker and OD was taken at 750 nm and flocculation efficiency was determined by the above formula. The experiment was done with 20 mL culture in 25 mL beaker at room temperature.\n\nElectrolytic flocculation (ECF)\nThe electrolytic cell with a diameter of 10 cm, a height of 15 cm was a glass reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Electrodes plates (5.5 × 4 cm) made from stainless steel were used as an electrode. The electrodes were submerged into the algal solution and were connected to a direct current power supply source. Inter electrode distance of 4 cm was maintained throughout the experiments. In 1 L beaker 400 ml of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 culture was used for the experiment. It was operated at different DC voltage (6, 9 and 12 V). During ECF, the microalgal suspension was stirred using magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm. Agitation was stopped with the initiation of the microalgal floc formation. Different concentration of NaCl (0.5 and 1 g L−1) was used to make the culture broth saline. Sample collection was done at every 15 min interval to find out the flocculation efficiency.\n\nZeta potential measurement\nThe zeta potential of the algae species was determined by Zetatrac analyzer using three mL cell dispersions in their respective medium before and after flocculation at various pH in the auto-flocculation study.\n\nCost estimation of different flocculation method\nFlocculation cost of microalgal biomass following different methods was estimated with flocculation efficiency ≥90 %. Chemicals were obtained from different vendor alum, ferric chloride from SRL and chitosan from Sigma–Aldrich. Price may vary from supplier to supplier. Power consumption was calculated in the process of electro-flocculation according to Vandamme et al. (2011). Electro-flocculation cost was determined on the basis of per unit power consumption when per unit price of electricity is 7.22 Rs/KWH (West Bengal, India).\n\nResults and discussion\nBiomass production of microalgae in air-lift bioreactor\nGrowth potential of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 was evaluated under the phototrophic indoor condition in customized air-lift reactor. After 9 d of cultivation, the maximum concentration of biomass 1.25 g/L and maximum productivity 0.25 gL−1d−1 for Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 were obtained. Synechocystis PCC 6803 produced maximum biomass 0.918 g L−1 and maximum productivity was 0.14 g L−1 d−1 (Fig. 2). Comparative analysis on the biomass productivities is \nshown in Table 1 which justifies the suitability of the present process for algal biomass production. Chlorella sp. MJ11/11 is a fast growing microalga as compared to some other microalgae spp. So, it was considered in the present study. The air-lift reactor was found to be a suitable photobioreactor for enhancing the biomass productivity. The air-lift reactor has the advantage of creating circular mixing where liquid culture passes continuously through dark and light phase that provide flashing light effect to algal cells (Barbosa et al. 2005). The moving cultivation surface helps in increasing the biomass productivity. These results indicated that Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 could be a promising feedstock for biodiesel production in the air-lift reactor.Fig. 2 Biomass concentration and biomass productivity of the Chlorella sp.

MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC6803\nAuto-flocculation was studied in Chlorella MJ11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 by increasing the pH (8–12.5). High flocculation efficiency was observed in case of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 (Fig. 3a). Flocculation efficiency increased sharply after pH 11 and was found maximum (85 %) at pH 12. At this pH, the zeta potential was found minimum. When the zeta potential is close to zero, particles approach each other mainly due to Van der Waals forces. When this happens, particles aggregate and flocculation occurs (Vandamme et al. 2013). It has been reported that above pH 10, calcium and magnesium ions present in the culture broth are precipitated as magnesium and calcium hydroxide. These are positively charged ions and adsorbed at negatively charged microalgal cells surface. Hence, neutralizes the negative charge and helps in reducing the repulsion forces among microalgal cells that lead to floc formation (Uduman et al. 2010). In case of Synechocystis PCC 6803 grown in BG-11 medium, no auto-flocculation was observed. It is suggested that proper concentrations of calcium and orthophosphate ions in the medium are important for auto-flocculation (Sukenik and Shelef 1984). Probably, hydroxides of calcium and magnesium formed in BG-11 were not sufficient to neutralize the negative charge present on its cell surfaces. The pH threshold is strain specific, e.g. Scenedesmus dimporphus only flocculates above pH 8.5 (Sukenik and Shelef 1984) while pH 12 is required for Chlorella sp. flocculation. These observations suggested that auto-flocculation depends on both the medium and the microorganism (Yahi et al. 1994).Fig. 3 \na Auto-flocculation efficiency and ζ potentials of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 at different pH; b flocculation efficiency of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 at different dosage and pH of FeCl3, c potassium aluminum sulfate, and d chitosan\n\n\n\n\nAuto-flocculation was found biomass concentration dependent (Table 2). At high biomass concentration (2.8 g/L) 32 % flocculation was observed while 0.98 g/L improved the flocculation efficiency to 82 %. Studies on Chlorella vulgaris (García-Pérez et al. 2014) suggested that the amount of magnesium hydroxide required for flocculation increases with increasing biomass concentration. Since the concentration of magnesium ions are constant in media which leads to less concentration of magnesium and calcium hydroxide formation hence less flocculation efficiency was found at higher biomass concentration.Table 2 Effect of different biomass concentrations on the flocculation efficiency of Chlorella sp MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803\n\nFlocculation techniques\tBiomass concentration (g L−1)\tFlocculation efficiency (%)\t\n\nChlorella sp.

These flocculants have been found effective in removing the impurities, colloidal particles and dissolved organic substances from water bodies (Duan and Gregory 2003). These inorganic coagulants have been reported for various algae biomass separation (Wyatt et al. 2012). In the present study, the flocculation efficiency was found proportional to the coagulant concentration (Fig. 3b). Maximum flocculation efficiencies 98 and 85 % were observed in the case of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803, respectively at 400 mg/L of ferric chloride. In the case of potassium aluminum sulfate, maximum efficiency (98.6 %) for Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and 92.3 % for Synechocystis PCC 6803 were observed at a concentration of 500 mg/L. The pH was found suitable between 4.8 and 5.4 (Fig. 3c). The effectiveness declined beyond the above pH range. At low biomass concentrations, higher flocculation efficiencies were observed. It was 98 and 87 % for Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803, respectively, at 1 g/L biomass concentration for ferric chloride and a similar type of result was found for potassium aluminum sulfate. The decrement of 10 % was found in the flocculation efficiency from low to higher biomass concentration for both species (Table 2). Mechanism of flocculation of potassium aluminum sulfate and ferric chloride was found to be similar as they form hydroxide when dissolving in water. It was suggested that aggregation of the cells occur due to the interaction between the cationic hydroxide complexes and anionic algal cell surface. Therefore, surface neutralization occurred in accordance with the principle of adsorption coagulation. The lower flocculant concentration follows charge neutralization mechanism resulting less biomass separation. While, at higher dose there is an extensive formation of hydroxide precipitate that attributes to sweep flocculation where mesh like algal floc patch synthesis entrapped free cells causing elevated efficiency (Duan and Gregory 2003). Algal cell surface carries a variety of functional groups whose characteristics changes depending upon pH (Wu et al. 2012). The addition of ferric chloride in the medium results in decrease in the pH of the solution due to the formation of ferric hydroxide and hydrochloric acid (Wyatt et al. 2012). Therefore, for better flocculation an optimum pH is necessary.\n\nChitosan-mediated flocculation\nChitosan is non-toxic, biodegradable and linear cationic polymer (Chen et al. 2011). In acidic conditions, chitosan has positively charged amine groups that are adsorbed to the negatively charged colloidal particle surface (Roussy et al. 2005). Flocculation occurs predominantly by the inter-particle bridging via polymer molecules that adsorb in a loop and tail conformation.\n\nFlocculation studies over a range of chitosan concentration (10–25 mg/L) were conducted with Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 (Fig. 3d). Initial biomass concentration was kept constant at 0.98 g/L. Flocculation efficiency of 86–90 % was observed with 10 mg/L chitosan concentration at pH 7.4. With increasing flocculants dose beyond 10 mg/L, over 90 % flocculation efficiency was achieved within 5–6 min resulting in the final efficiency of 98 %. At higher concentration of chitosan (25 mg/L) in both organisms, similar flocculation efficiency (98–98.5 %) was observed. Some have reported maximum flocculation at pH 7 (Divakaran and Pillai 2002) whereas pH 8.5 for Chlorella sorokiniana (Chen et al. 2011; Grima et al. 2003). However, in the present study pH 7.4 was found to be optimum for flocculation that was 94 and 90 % for Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803, respectively. Roussy et al. (2005) identified that at intermediate pH both the coagulation and flocculation processes occurred in biopolymer mediated flocculation of bentonite suspensions. Further, the difference in optimal pH and flocculation efficiency of microalgae might be due to the difference in culture media, growth conditions and unique strain properties, such as cell morphology, extracellular organic matter and cell surface charge (Xu et al. 2013). The flocculation efficiency showed a decreasing trend with the rise in biomass concentration (Table 2). Since, the increase in biomass concentration increases total negative surface charges in the solution. Hence, a more positive charge would be required for neutralization. Therefore, at constant flocculant concentration decreasing trends with biomass was found.\n\nElectrolytic coagulation-flocculation\nThe electrolytic flocculation experiments are based on the principle of the movement of electrically charged particles in an electric field. Microalgae have a negative surface charge that causes them to be attracted towards the anode during the electrolysis of the algal suspension. They reach to the anode and lose their charges that make them able to form algal aggregates.\n\nWith increasing voltage, flocculation efficiency was found to increase (Fig. 4). In the present study, three different voltage 6 V (5.967774 A/m2), 9 V (8.594347 A/m2), 12 V (10.9529 A/m2) of DC were applied. Maximum flocculation efficiency of 96 % was found at 12 V as compared to 42 and 66 % at 6 and 9 V, respectively, using Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11. But in case of Synechocystis PCC 6803 grown in BG-11 no coagulation-floatation was observed during 75 min of the reaction period. It might be due to lack of enough electrolyte concentration to facilitate the electro coagulation-floatation understudied range of voltage. With increasing the voltage, current density increases which determine the coagulant dosage rate, the bubble production rate, size and the flocs growth resulting faster removal efficiency at a higher voltage (Khosla et al. 1991). In this process, floatation of biomass was observed which is advantageous over sedimentation because it can be skimmed off easily which is favored in mass cultivation of algae (Edzwald 1993). Electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen gas at the electrodes. The bubbles produced at the anode (oxygen) and cathode (hydrogen) rise to the surface taking with them algal aggregates or flocs. The electrolysis leads to the flocculation and flotation of the algae at the same time without the usual addition of chemical flocculants.Fig. 4 Effect of voltage and pH on the flocculation efficiency of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 and Synechocystis PCC 6803\n\n\n\nWhen NaCl was added then a very fast reaction of coagulation-flocculation was observed in both type of microalgal suspension. Both organisms showed more than 90 % flocculation efficiency. Time was reduced from 30 to 15 min when the concentration of NaCl was increased from 0.5 g/L (13.73941 A/m2) to 1 g/L (16.62971 A/m2) (Table 3). The addition of NaCl increased the conductivity of suspension because of increased electrolyte concentration. Hence, high flocculation efficiency was observed in lesser time. When initial pH was kept in acidic condition, flocculation efficiency was found more than the alkaline condition in the same period (Fig. 4). In alkaline conditions, monomeric-hydroxy ferric anions are dominated in solution, which led to negative charges of the ferric hydroxide precipitates. In acidic and neutral pH range (6–7), ferric hydroxide precipitates and monomeric-hydroxo and polymeric ferric cations species are the primary species in the solution (Dermentzis et al. 2011). These positively charged precipitates would be easily adsorbed onto the negatively charged microalgae, which facilitated the removal of algae. Hence, Initial acidic pH was found more effective.Table 3 Effect of NaCl on electro-flocculation (ECF) using Chlorella sp.

It has been reported that algae settle in the water column affected by intrinsic features such as buoyancy, surface charge, size, and shape of the cell. The cyanobacterial cells can regulate buoyancy with physical and chemical factors (Fernández and Ballesteros 2013; Chorus and Bartram 1999). Therefore, Synechocystis PCC 6803 sedimentation rate was observed to be lower than Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11. Flocculation efficiencies of different flocculation methods using both the organisms are shown in Table 4.Table 4 Comparative study of different flocculation techniques for harvesting of microalgae\n\nMethods\tConcentration of flocculant (mg L−1)\tOptimum pH\tSettling time (min)\tMaximum flocculation efficiency\t\n\nChlorella sp.

Other researchers have estimated the price of different flocculant mediated cell separation and have reported $0.7, 0.3, 31.1 for ferric chloride, potassium aluminum sulfate, and chitosan, respectively, for 1000 L of suspension culture of different microalgae (Rakesh et al. 2014). However, the concentration of biomass was not reported in their study. In the present study, cost of flocculants were found to be INR 210.00, 160.00, 1066.00, 79.80 for potassium aluminum sulfate, ferric chloride, chitosan, and electro-flocculation, respectively, for the recovery of 1 kg of algal biomass at the laboratory scale (Table 5). Thus, electro-flocculation was found a low-cost technique (INR 79.80 per kg dry biomass) than inorganic and biopolymer flocculants.Table 5 Comparative cost economics of flocculation\n\n\tAlum\tFerric chloride\tChitosan\tElectro-flocculationa\n\t\nCell concentration (g/L)\t1\t1\t1\t0.98\t\nFlocculant quantity needed (mg/L)\t500\t400\t10\t–\t\nUnit price of flocculantb (Rs/kg)\t420\t400\t106,600\t–\t\nFlocculation cost for 1 kg algal biomass (Rs/kg)c\n\t210\t160\t1066\t79.80\t\n\naCost- power consumption in the process of electro-flocculation according to García-Pérez et al.

In the air-lift reactor, high biomass productivity of Chlorella sp. MJ 11/11 was obtained which could be a potential feedstock for lipid production. Auto-flocculation process was found strain specific and effective at lower concentrations of biomass as compared to other flocculation processes. Potassium aluminum sulfate, FeCl3 showed potency in flocculation, but contamination may be an issue. On the other hand, chitosan was found eco-friendly but its high cost makes it unattractive for low-value products. Stainless-steel mediated electro-flocculation was found most suitable for the recovery of algal cells mainly due to low-cost, high flocculation efficiency, easy control of the process, floatation of biomass. However, further improvement in electro-flocculation can be done by optimizing different parameters of the process to make it more economically viable.\n\nThe financial support received from

The strain grew optimally at 45 °C (growth range between 24 and 50 °C) and pH 7 (growth pH range between pH 5 and 9) in Luria Broth supplemented with 0.3 % glucose. Strain D7XPN1 tolerated up to 7 % NaCl and showed amylolytic and xylanolytic activities. 16S rRNA gene analysis placed strain D7XPN1 in the cluster represented by Bacillus subtilis and the genome analysis of the 4.1 Mb genome sequence determined using RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) indicated a total of 5116 genomic features were present of which 2320 features could be grouped into several subsystem categories. Of these, 615 features were related to carbohydrate metabolism which included a range of enzymes with potential in the biodegradation of food wastes, a property consistent with the ecological habitat of the isolate. ANIb (Average Nucleotide Identity based on BLAST) analysis with 49 Bacillus subtilis genomes indicated that it was distantly related to the three currently taxonomically validated B. subtilis subspecies namely B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (95.6 %), B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii (93 %) and B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (92 %) and based on our current knowledge warranted that it be included as a separate cluster together with strain JS which it was closely related (98.69 %). The close relationship of strains D7XPN1 and JS is also supported from our results from electronic DNA–DNA Hybridization (e-DDH) studies. Furthermore, our additional in-depth phylogenomic analyses using three different datasets unequivocally supported the creation of a fourth B. subtilis subspecies to include strains D7XPN1 and JS for which we propose strain D7XPN1T (=KCTC 33554T, JCM 30051T) as the type strain, and designate it as B. subtilis subsp. stecoris.\n\nKeywords\nModerate thermophileBacillus subtilis subspeciesPhylogenomicsBacillus subtilis subspecies stecorisissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nThe members of the genus Bacillus comprise the low G+C containing Gram-positive bacteria and belong to the family Bacillaceae, order Bacillales, class Bacilli, phylum Firmicutes, domain Bacteria. They grow in a diverse range of habitats and include species that grow at extreme temperatures, salinities and pH. The phenotypic traits and physiologies of members of the genus Bacillus are as dynamic and wide ranging as their habitats and include species that grow as heterotrophs, autotrophs, in the presence or absence of oxygen and yet others grow in the presence of alternate electron acceptors such as iron, arsenate (Kanso et al. 2002). The extreme metabolic diversity, their non-pathogenic nature and the ease of isolating, handling and maintainance has opened them to biotechnological exploitation and in particular for use in agriculture, e.g. crop protection (Gao et al. 2015; Hussein et al. 2015; Ji et al. 2008). 16S rRNA-based taxonomy is routinely used to build taxonomic relationship amongst members of the domain Bacteria but it is well established that this technique fails to resolve closely related Bacillus species in which evolutionary divergence is limited. Given the lack of discriminatory power of 16S rRNA genes, a polyphasic taxonomic approach which combines 16S rRNA sequence analysis with phenotypic traits and DNA–DNA homology has been recommended to improve resolution. Examples of such an approach include the members of the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group which currently comprises of 6 species (B. cereus, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B. mycoides and B. psedomycoides and B. weihenstephanensis (Zwick et al. 2012) and the B. subtilis group which comprises of 3 species B. subtilis, B.vallismortis and B. mojavensis (Roberts et al. 1994, 1996). However, the topology of polyphasic trees is not always robust and can differ from the 16S rRNA based trees and therefore delineating species and strain boundaries using a polyphasic approach can be confusing. With the advent of the high throughput cost effective Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, estimation of overall similarity of microbial genomes by Genome-to-Genome Distance Comparison (GGDC), Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and genome phylogeny are being considered not only for delineating closely related species but also for taxonomic assignment of new isolates (Maughan and Van der Auwera 2011; Yi et al. 2014). Here we describe the construction of a molecular phylogenetic framework for Bacillus subtilis using genome sequences and its application to strain D7XPN1, an isolate from Baku Baku King™, a commercial food-waste degrading bioreactor (Adelskov 2013; Adelskov and Patel 2014).\n\nMaterials and methods\nBioreactor operation and sample collection\nBiodegradation of food-wastes was carried out using Baku Baku King™ (model: M.I.G.0100), a food waste bioreactor. The biodegradation process was started in the bioreactor (day 0) by mixing 50 kg of municipal food waste sourced from a local hotel (Novotel Hotel, Gold Coast) with 200 kg of methyl bromide treated Japanese Larch wood chips and a microbial starter seed culture. The starter microbial seed culture was prepared by mixing 10 kg of leaf litter (collected from the Forest reserve located at Griffith University Nathan campus, Brisbane, Australia), with nutrients (sugar, honey, milk, meat, fish) followed by incubation for one week at room temperature (25–30 °C) before inoculation into the bioreactor. The bioreactor was subsequently fed 50 kg of municipal food waste per day sourced from the same hotel over a 49 day period. Samples (approximately 500 g) were collected from the bioreactor every 7–10 days of its normal operation cycle of 49 days including day 0 (the day of inoculation of the bioreactor with a starter seed culture). In total, seven samples were collected (days 0, 1, 7, 17, 21, 29 and 49). The temperature and aeration in the bioreactor was controlled by the inbuilt bioreactor’s electronic system.\n\nEnrichment, isolation and phylogeny\n1 g of bioreactor samples was resuspended in 10 ml sterile dH2O the solution shaken for 2 min and the debris allowed to settled for 5 min. 200 µl of settled suspension was spread on dTSA agar medium [dTSA consisted of 0.1 % (w/v) Tryptic Soy Broth, 1.5 % (w/v) bacteriological agar, pH 7.2]. The temperature of the bioreactor during most of the operation period was between 40 and 45 °C and hence the plates were incubated at 45 °C until colonies developed. Single well-isolated colonies that appeared morphologically distinct were picked and resuspended in sterile dH2O and a loopful streaked onto dTSA agar plates and incubated at 45 °C until colonies developed. This procedure was repeated several times before the isolates were considered to be pure. 28 pure cultures (Table 1) were obtained using this process and were stored at 4 °C and −20 °C. All isolates were routinely cultured using 0.1 % (w/v) (dilute) Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB), pH 7.2.Table 1 List of strains isolated from the waste-food degrading bioreactor, Baku Baku™\n\nDay\tIsolate\tColony morphologya\n\tEnzyme activityb\n\tClosest phylogenetic memberc\n\t\nXylanase\tAmylase\t\n0\tBXP1\tIrregular, white, 2–3 mm\t–\t+\t\nBacillus subtilis str. 168\t\n0\tBXP7\tSlighly irregular, mucoid, white, 2–3 mm\t–\t+\t\nBacillus vallismortis str.

In brief, bacterial cells were resuspended in a buffered solution (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.8) and treated with 0.8 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.3 mg/ml Achromopeptidase and 0.1 mg/ml RNAse A and subsequently lysed by adding 0.12 mg/ml Proteinase K and 6 mg/ml sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to the suspension. The DNA from the lysate was purified using phenol:chloroform extraction. Purified DNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA concentration determined fluorometrically using a Qubit™ dsDNA HS assay kit as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, USA). The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from the DNA of the isolate by PCR using the universal forward primer Fd1 (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and reverse primer Rd1 (AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC) that bind to the 8–27 and 1512–1493 base pair positions of E. coli numbering scheme according to Winkler and Woese (1991). Reactions of 50 µl volume consisted of: 0.2 mMdNTP, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Fd1, 1 mM Rd1, 0.5–5 ng of DNA template, 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (Mango Taq) and provided reaction buffer. PCR proceeded using a Corbett Research FTS-1 Thermal sequencer with the following cycle program: cycle 1; 2 min 95 °C; 1 min 50 °C; 2 min 70 °C, cycle 2–32; 55 s 94 °C, 1 min 50 °C, 2 min 72 °C. The reaction amplicon was purified by either SureClean™ or Gel extraction (QIAGEN) following manufacturer’s instructions. The purified amplicons were sequenced on an ABI 3730xl 96-capillary sequencer using Fd1 and Rd1 primers at AGRF (Australian Genetics Research Facility). 16S rRNA gene sequence manipulation and phylogenetic analysis was performed as described previously (Redburn and Patel 1994).\n\nAll isolates were screened for the presence of amylase activity by inoculating a loopful of culture onto dTSA agar medium supplemented with 1 % soluble potato starch (Chem Supply, Australia) and incubation at 45 °C until colonies developed. The plates were flooded with Gram’s Iodine solution and a positive reaction for amylase production recorded for isolates when there was a zone of clearance around colonies against a red–purple background. Isolates were screened for xylanase activity by streaking X-xyl Agar plates followed by incubation at 45 °C. X-xyl Agar plates contained (g−L distilled water): Tryptic Soy Broth (Oxoid, USA) 1 g, xylan from birchwood (Sigma, USA) 3 g, Bacteriological Agar (Oxoid, USA) 15 g, X-β-D-xyloside (Gold Biotech, USA) 0.2 g, pH 7.2 and incubated at 45 °C. Xylanase production was recorded as positive when colonies showed a blue color.\n\nOne of the isolates designated D7XPN1, which produced a xylanase and amylase, was selected for further studies and is described in more detail in this paper.\n\nCharacterization of strain D7XPN1\nTemperature, pH and salinity growth studies were conducted in 18 mm glass culture tubes containing 15 ml of modified Luria Bertoni Broth (mLBB). mLBB contained per litre Luria Bertoni Broth (Oxoid, USA) 25 g, d-Glucose anhydrous (Lab Supply, Australia) 3 g. For temperature studies, mLLB was inoculated with 0.2 ml of an overnight culture and incubated in water baths maintained at 37, 45, 50, 60, 70 °C and incubated for 48 h. For pH studies, the pH of mLBB was changed to the desired pH (pH range of 4.0–10) by addition of 1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH, inoculated with 0.2 ml of an overnight culture and incubated in water baths maintained at 45 °C. For salinity studies, appropriate amounts of NaCl was weighed and added to mLBB medium to achieve the desired concentration of salinity (3–7 %), inoculated with 0.2 ml of an overnight culture and incubated in a water bath maintained at 45 °C for 48 h. Following incubation, growth was determined by inserting the glass culture tubes directly into a modified cuvette holder of a Novaspec LKB spectrophotometer and the absorbance measured at 600 nm. Anaerobic growth was tested in Trypticase, Yeast Extract, Glucose (TYEG) medium as described previously (Ogg and Patel 2009).\n\nDataset and genome sequencing\nUnless indicated otherwise, all computational analysis was performed using a 16 CPU Dell workstation with 64 gigabytes RAM and an Intel® Xeon(R) CPU X5570 @ 2.93 GHz × 8 chipset running Ubuntu 12.04 and the Australian Government Information Technology Infrastructure Facilities accessed under the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) program.\n\nComplete and draft Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) for all strains that were identified in GenBank microbial genome database as Bacillus subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens and B. atrophaeus were downloaded from the NCBI ftp server ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/bacteria (release 204) (Table 2). Unless indicated otherwise, sequence contigs from all GenBank files were extracted and converted to fasta format (Vesth et al. 2013) and any plasmid sequences accompanying the genome data (B. subtilis subsp. natto str. BEST195, B. subtilis subsp. str. NCIB 3610 and B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. B7-s) were removed before use in comparative genomic studies.Table 2 \nBacillus subtilis strains used in determining the Overall Genome Relatedness Indices (OGRI) using Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculations (GGDC) and Average Nucleotide Identity by Blast (ANIb) and phylogenomics\n\nNo.\t\nB. subtilis strain\tAccession Number\tSample source\tTotal nucleotide (bp)\tNo. of Contigs\tLargest Contig size (%)\tN25\tN50\tN75\tG+C mol %\t\nCluster 1.

The sequencing data was converted to FASTQ format and adapters were removed from individual reads. The quality of the sequencing data was assessed using PRINSEQ (http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/) (Schmieder and Edwards 2011). Genomic contigs were assembled from reads using the GS de novo Assembler (Newbler) software (http://454.com/products/analysis-software/index.asp). The assembled draft genome was annotated using Prokka, version 1.10 (Seemann 2014) and the RAST automated annotation pipeline server (http://rast.nmpdr.org/) (Aziz et al. 2008), which employs subsystems technology to identify genes related to different categories of cellular processes and metabolism (Overbeek et al. 2014). The whole-genome shotgun project of Bacillus subtilis strain D7XPN1 (= KCTC 33554, JCM 30051) has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession number JHCA00000000. The version described in this paper is version JHCA00000000.1.\n\nEstimation of overall genome relatedness indices (OGRI) for strain D7XPN1\nOGRI methods depend on comparisons of whole genome rather than single genes or a set of genes and ANIb has been established as a method of choice. ANIb was performed with genome nucleotide sequences using the calculate_ani.py script (https://github.com/widdowquinn/scripts) that incorporates the ANI algorithm by Richter and Rossello-Mora (2009). In addition, intergenomic e-DDH distances were calculated using Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC) with the recommended formula as described by Meier-Kolthoff et al. (2013).\n\nPhylogenomics\nThe use of groups of orthologous proteins or a set of common conserved genes across genomes is required for phylogenomic analysis and several methods are available for such studies. In our study, we first used Prokka (version 1.10) (Seemann 2014) to identify open reading frames (ORF) of genome nucleotide sequences (n = 43), which were subsequently translated into putative protein sequences and annotated. We then created two protein datasets for phylogenomic studies. For the first, we used the hal pipeline with default settings to find and extract all protein orthologs (Robbertse et al. 2011) and for the second, we used CD-Hit (Huang et al. 2010) to select for a smaller but highly conserved set of orthologuous proteins from the annotations (>97 % AA identity). Additionally, we used the 6 conserved MLST gene dataset (glpF, pta, purH, pycA, rpoD and tpiA) typically used for typing strains of Bacillus subtilis for phylogenomic Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA). The 6 genes were downloaded from pubMLST database and used in local BLAST queries against the Bacillus subtilis genome database of open reading frames (ORF) and the MLST genes retrieved. The datasets of the conserved protein sequences from hal and CD-Hit and the MLST nucleotide sequences were aligned separately using CLUSTALW (http://www.clustal.org/clustal2) (Larkin et al. 2007), concatenated into a single super-alignment and used to construct Maximum Likelihood trees using PhyML (Guindon et al. 2010).\n\nResults\nStrain isolation and phylogenetic identification\n28 strains were isolated from bioreactor samples collected over 49 days of operation. The strains were selected on the basis of differences in colony morphology, growth rates and enzyme screening (amylase and xylanase) (Table 1). 16S rRNA gene (sequence length between 560 and 1555 bp) analysis revealed that 27 of the 28 isolates were members of the genera Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Kurthia and Aneurinibacillus, phylum Firmicutes, domain Bacteria (Fig. 1) whereas\nthe 28th isolate, identified using 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis (sequence length 1738 bp) analysis as Ogataea polymorpha, a yeast (data not shown). Further phylogenetic analysis showed that 9 of the isolates cultured from samples taken from the bioreactor on days 0, 1, 7, 17, 21, 29, and 49 of its operation cycle (Table 1), and which included strain D7XPN1, were closely related to Bacillus subtilis (99 % similarity) (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Phylogenetic distance tree constructed from partial 16S rRNA sequences (467 nucleotides) of bacterial strains isolated from samples retrieved from Baku Baku™ a food waste bioreactor. Distance estimation was obtained using the Jukes and Cantor model. Bootstrap percentages after 1000 replications are shown. Scale bar represents one nucleotide change in every 100 nucleotides. Refer to Table 2 for the type strains in this figure\n\n\n\nPhenotypic characterization of strain D7XPN1\nThe cells of strain D7XPN1 were short rods which stained Gram positive and produced cream coloured, opaque, raised, irregular-shaped colonies on dTSA medium. Strain D7XPN1 grew optimally at 45 °C (growth temperature between 24 and 50 °C) suggesting that it was a thermotolerant/moderate thermophile and pH 7 (pH growth range between pH 5 and pH 9). The strain tolerated up to 7 % NaCl (the highest tested) and grew anaerobically by fermentation in the absence of oxygen.\n\nGenome studies of strain D7XPN1\nA total 722,222 reads with a mean read length of 196.13 bp (total of 141,651,194 bp) were produced using IonTorrent™. The assembly of these reads with GS assembler (Newbler) produced 28 genomic contigs (average coverage of 40x) with contig sizes ranging from 1,017,528 to 510 bp in length and a N50 of 504,008 bp. RAST server identified a total of 5116 genomic features that included 69 RNA and 5047 protein coding sequences (Fig. 2). Of the 5047 total features, 2,320 were placed into functional subsystems. Two subsystems categories related to carbohydrates and amino acid and derivatives had the highest number of associated features with 615 and 506 coding features, respectively.Fig. 2 \na RAST annotation gene functional categories of Bacillus subtilis str. D7XPN1. a The pie graph of the total numbers of CDS is divided into 3 categories (in %)—CDS annotations that are represented in the RAST subsystem, those that are not represented (non-subsystem), and those that annotations that are hypothetical. b The bar graph shows the total subsystem CDS annotations by major subsystem categories\n\n\n\nEstimation of overall genome relatedness indices (OGRI)\n49 strains which had a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of ≥97 % to B. subtilis strain 168, together with genomes of the members of B. subtilis sensu lato group, B. atrophaeus and strain D7XPN1 were initially used in the ANIb studies (Table 2). The study showed that 43 strains with an ANIb similarity values >92 % could be regarded as members of B. subtilis (Fig. 3) whereas the remaining 6 strains \nwhose similarity values were <92 %, should be examined more closely. Closer examinations showed that B. subtilis strain GBO3, B. subtilis strain SPZ1 and B. subtilis str. NKYL29 shared a high ANIb similarity value (97 %) with B. amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis subsp. niger str. PCI with B. atrophaeus (99.9 %) (Table 3). Additionally, review of the literature showed that the genome of B. subtilis strain BEST7613 was a chimeric construct of the genomes of Synechocystis strain PCC6803 and B. subtilis 168 (Watanabe et al. 2012) and the examination of the statistics of the genome of B. subtilis B7-S showed that it had a genome that was substantially different in size (5.3 Mb) and in G+C mol % content (35.1) to 43 members of the B. subtilis cluster. These 6 misclassified strains were therefore removed from further analysis.Fig. 3 ANIb heatmap of Bacillus subtilis genome sequences (n = 43). Individual genome-to-genome ANIb values are represented in the central bi-color gradient heatmap, the color key shown on the top left had side including adivison line for the recommended subspecies cutoff value (97 %). The heatmap is accompanied by a hierarchical clustering dendrogram with for distinct clades (clusters): B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (A, green), B. subtilis subsp. stecoris (B, pink), B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii (C, yellow) and B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (D, blue). Refer to Table 2 for the type strains in this figure\n\nFig. 4 GGDC estimated DNA–DNA Hybridization (DDH, formula 2) of a selected set of B. subtilis genomic strains representing the three current sub-species and the proposed fourth sub-species\n\n\n\nThe remaining 43 strains could be further grouped into 4 clusters based on ANIb similarity values (Fig. 3). Cluster 1 constituted the largest group (33 strains) with a ANIb similarity value of >98 % amongst the members and is represented by the taxonomically validated B. subtilis subsp. subtilis. Of the 33 strains, 16 have already been identified as members of cluster 1. Cluster 2 consists of the two newly isolated strains JS (Song et al. 2012) and D7XPNI (Adelskov and Patel 2014), (Fig. 2) which have an ANIb similarity value of 95.6 % to cluster 1 and to each other by 98.8 %. These two strains have not been taxonomically validated previously and in this report we propose to describe these two strains as members of a new subspecies, B. subtilis subsp stecori of which strain D7XPN1T is the type sub-species. Cluster 3 is composed of two strains of the taxonomically validated B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (Table 1) with an ANIb similarity value of 92 and 93 % to clusters 1 and 2, respectively and to each other by 98.6 %. The remaining 6 strains belong to a loose cluster represented by the taxonomically validated B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii which have an ANIb similarity value of between 92 and 94 % with members of clusters 1, 2 and 3. Of the 6 strains, 4 strains have been correctly identified as members of this cluster (Table 2). Of the 6 strains, 4 strains (B. subtilis str. BSC154, B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii str. W23, B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii str. ATCC 6633 and B. subtilis str. BST) group closely together (ANIb value of >99 %) whereas B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. DV1-B-1 and B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii str. TU-B-10 are more distant (ANIb values of 95.6 and 92.2 %, respectively) to the 4 strains.\n\nDNA homology using genome-to-genome-distance-calculator (GGDC)\nDNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) method is a gold standard that is used to differentiate species of the same genus when the 16S rRNA sequence similarity is >97 %. The widely accepted species boundary set by the DDH method is 70 %. The Genome-to-Genome-Distance-Calculator (GGDC) is an in silico alternate for the traditional experimental DDH method and is the second OGRI method used in our study. As all the B. subtilis strains (n = 43) have a 16S rRNA similarity value >97 %, we have calculated the GGDC similarity indices of representatives genomes from each of the 4 sub-species clusters. The results show that B. subtilis subsp. stecori strains D7XPN1 and JS of cluster 2 share a genome similarity of 88.6 % to each other and 62.2–62.9 % with strains of cluster 1 represented by B. subtilis subsp. subtilis and <51 % with strains from the clusters 3 and 4 represented by B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii and B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (Fig. 4).\n\nPhylogenomic analysis\nPhylogenomic trees produced from the analysis of 1724 core protein sequence orthologs (436,410 aa) and the more conserved 534 protein sequence orthologs generated from CD-Hit analysis (≥97 % amino acids similarity) are presented in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively and the Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) tree generated from the 6 genes routinely used in Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) of B. subtilis strains is shown in Fig. 7. All 3 trees resolve Bacillus strains (n = 43) into 4 clusters with the same topology and with 100 % bootstrap values at each branch point of the clusters and the phylogenomic studies supports the results from genome to genome comparisons studies of ANIb and DDH (Fig. 3) though there are slight changes in the topology of the internal branches of cluster 1 representing B. subtilis subsp. subtilis.Fig. 5 Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree of B. subtilis (n = 43) constructed from a superalignment of sequences from 1724 protein orthologs of B. subtilis genomes using the hal pipeline with default parameters. Distances were corrected using the Jone-Taylor (JTT) model with 1000 non-parametric bootstrap replicates. The bootstrap values are represented by numbers at nodes.

The scale\nbar represents a difference of 1 in every 1000 amino acids (0.1 %).

Distances were corrected using the model of Hasegawa et al. (1985) with 1000 non-parametric bootstrap replicates. The bootstrap values are represented at each node. Scale bar represents a difference of 1 in 100 nucleotides (1 %). Refer to Table 2 for the type strains in Table 1\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIt is well-established that 16S rRNA phylogeny does not readily separate closely related strains of Bacillussubtilis and including differentiating phenotypic characteristics to phylogenetic data does not necessarily assist in taxonomic delineation. For example, dark pigmented colonies are a distinctive feature of B. atrophaeus but some strains of B. subtilis also produce such colonies (Nakamura 1989). Several recent studies have discussed the need to establish microbial taxonomy on the basis of information retrieved from microbial genomes especially when 16S rRNA similarity values are >97 % and many computational methods, which can be categorised into two broad groups, have been reported in the literature (Bull et al. 2012; Larsen et al. 2014). Computational methods which rely purely on comparison of nucleotide sequences of genomes, have been recently coined by Chun and Rainey (2014) as Overall Genome Relatedness Indices (OGRI) methods and include ANI, GGDC, GBDP (Genome Blast Distance Phylogeny), Maximal Unique Matches Index (MUMi) whereas methods which rely on comparison of conserved genomic features (e.g. core genes and proteins) where sequence disparities are the result of evolutionary pressures, are known as phylogenomic methods.\n\nIn this study we isolated 28 strains from a food-waste degrading commercial bioreactor of which 9 isolates could only be assigned as strains of B. subtilis based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis (Fig. 1). We selected strain D7XPN1 as representative of the 9 isolates, sequenced and using OGRI (ANIb and DDH) and phylogenomic methods compared it’s genome with genomes of B. subtilis and B. subtilis-like strains that had been retrieved from NCBI database. For this we initially downloaded 49 B.subtilis genomes but were left with only 43 after identifying and removing mixed or misclassified genomes. Of these remaining genomes of 43 B. subtilis strains, 21 strains had already been used by Yi et al. (2014) in their studies and our results support their conclusions that ANIb can be used to separate B. subtilis into 3 subspecies. They had further suggested that if the threshold ANIb value of 95–96 % were to be used for species delineation than B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii and B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum should be designated as new species. ANIb analysis of the additional 22 strains which were not part of the studies of Yi et al. (2014) revealed that 20 could be assigned to one of the 3 clusters defined by Yi et al. (2014) but a further 2 strains, strains JS and D7XPN1, were closely related to each other (ANib value of 98.8 %) and formed a separate cluster, designated cluster 2. Cluster 2 was a sister branch of cluster 1 and was more closely related to it than to clusters 3 and 4 (ANIb values of 95.6, 93 and 92–94 %, respectively).\n\nBased on the conservative cut off DDH value of 70 %, B. subtilis strains (n = 43) can be assigned to 4 clusters, each represented by a subspecies and is consistent with the findings of the ANIb analysis. The results also confirm that strains D7XPN1 and JS are related more closely to each other than to members of cluster 1 represented by B. subtilis subsp. subtilis and supports results from the ANIb analysis. In addition, all the 3 phylogenomic trees generated using 3 different data sets (1724, 534, and 6 core orthologs) resolve Bacillus strains (n = 43) into 4 clusters with the same topology and with 100 % bootstrap values at each branch point of the clusters and the phylogenomic studies supports the results from genome to genome comparisons studies of ANIb and DDH studies though there are slight changes in the topology of the internal branches of cluster 1 representing B. subtilis subsp. subtilis.\n\nPhylogenomic studies indicate that there are differences in the gene and protein content of the 43 strains. Doolittle and Zhaxybayeva (2009) have hypothesised that the acquisition of genes can affect changes in an ecological niche and that even the closest relatives could be ecologically distinct ecotypes. Kopac et al. (2014) in their studies on B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii (cluster 4), which has 6 members, 4 of which were isolated from Death Valley, showed that all the genomes of the four Death Valley strains differed in gene content supporting the hypothesis of Doolittle and Zhaxybayeva (2009) that even the closest relatives could be ecologically distinct ecotypes. However, Kopac et al. (2014) were unable to demonstrate if the acquisition of genes could in fact change the metabolic dynamism of the ecological niche.\n\nIt would be interesting to extend the studies to B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (cluster 1) the most widely represented strains in B. subtilis but for the fact that the strains have been isolated from a very wide range of environments and therefore any differences found in the gene content could be considered to be biased due to habitat differences. We have in our study reported here 9 strains of B. subtilis isolated from samples taken from the bioreactor on days 0, 1, 7, 17, 21, 29, and 49 of its operation cycle (Table 1), all of which are closely related (16S rRNA similarity >99 % similarity). Strain D7XPN1 reported in our studies, was isolated from a sample collected on day 7 and is a representative of the nine B. subtilis strains. Strain D7XPN1 is capable of growing at moderate thermophilic temperatures and contains an array of enzymes for degradation of polysaccharides including a xylanase and an amylase. We intend to sequence and compare the genomes of all the 9 strains and if the hypothesis of Doolittle and Zhaxybayeva (2009) holds true then we should be able to see differences in the gene profiles which would potentially be reflective of the change in environmental conditions in the waste-degrading bioreactor, from day 0 to day 49.\n\nThe genome of strain JS isolated from the soil of a pot planted with Miscanthus sp. was sequenced and a number of genes associated with plant growth promoting and antifungal activities were identified (Song et al. 2012). In addition, the use of volatile extracts of strain JS were found to reduce the disease in bacterial infected tobacco plants (Kim et al. 2015). Our analysis of the annotations of the genome of strain D7XPN1 has also identified potential plant growth-promoting genes similar to those found in strain JS. The properties of strain D7XPN1 has potential for use as an inoculum source to improve and increase efficiency of the food-waste degradation process at thermophiic temperatures but additionally, it also has the potential for use as a plant growth promoting fertilizer at the completion of the degradation process.\n\nStrains JS and D7XPN1 have not yet been taxonomically validated but based on the OGRI and phylogenomic results reported here, we propose to describe these two strains as members of a newly created subspecies that we designate B. subtilis subsp stecori of which strain D7XPN1T is the type sub-species. Furthermore, we propose that once more strains of clusters 2, 3 and 4 have been isolated and their genome sequences analysed than if necessary, the reassignment of the B. subtilis strains should be reconsidered given the low ANIb (≤95–96 %) and DDH values (<70 %) which demarcate each of the fourclusters.\n\nDescription of Bacillus subtilis subsp. stecoris subsp. nov\nBacillus subtilis subsp. stecoris [ste.co.ris.L. gen. n. compost, from which the strain was isolated].

Role of Elspar® (l-asparaginase from Escherichia coli) in regulation of l-Asn and l-Gln has been confirmed by the other researchers through experimental studies. Therapeutic research against ALL remained elusive with the lack of information on molecular interactions of Elspar® with amino acid substrates. In the present study, using different docking tools binding cavities, key residues in binding and ligand binding mechanisms were identified. For the apo state enzyme and ligand bound state complexes, MD simulations were performed. Trajectory analysis for 30 ns run confirmed the kinship of l-Asn with l-asparaginase enzyme in the dynamic system with less stability in comparison to l-Gln docked complex. Overall findings strongly supported the bi-functional nature of the enzyme drug. A good number of conformational changes were observed with 1NNS structure due to ligand binding. Results of present study give much more information on structural and functional aspects of E. colil-asparaginase upon the interaction with its ligands which may be useful in designing effective therapeutics for ALL.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-015-0339-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nl-asparaginaseMolecular dockingMolecular dynamic simulationsAcute lymphocytic leukemiaNilissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nUncontrolled division of cells is defined as cancer. Cancer of white blood cells (WBC), characterized by excessive multiplication of malignant and immature WBC (lymphoblast) in bone marrow is referred to as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods of treatment of acute leukemia include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, steroids, and intensive combined treatments including stem cell or bone marrow transplants. Chemotherapy is the most preferred way of treatment among the above. Various drugs employed for treatment of ALL include asparaginase, dexamethasone, prednisolone, vincristine, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, etoposide, thioguanine, mercaptopurine, hydrocortisone, methotrexate etc.\n\nRecently l-asparaginase has evolved as an important enzyme in growing enzyme industry, owing to its potential use in the treatment of ALL and lymphosarcoma (Story et al. 1993; Verma et al. 2007) and also in food industry to prevent acrylamide formation in fried foods at high temperatures (Pedreschi et al. 2008). l-asparaginase catalyzes the hydrolysis of amide group of side chain in l-Asn to yield l-aspartate and ammonia. By treating patients with l-asparaginase, circulating plasma pools l-Asn levels were effectively depleted in the body (Fig. 1), resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis followed by inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis. It causes apoptic cell death of leukemic cells, thereby makes it selective against the leukemic cells without affecting the normal cells (Nandy et al. 1997). As some leukemic cells are unable to synthesize the asparagine synthetase enzyme, they are totally dependent on circulating extracellular l-Asn. Currently l-asparaginase purified from Escherichia coli is extensively used in clinical treatment of leukemia which is available in the market with the brand name of Elspar® (PDB ID: 1NNS). The possible side effects reported with Elspar® include severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); fever; pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site; symptoms of liver problems (e.g., dark urine, pale stools, nausea, loss of appetite, unusual tiredness, yellowing of the skin, or eyes); symptoms of pancreatitis (e.g., severe stomach or back pain with or without nausea or vomiting); neurological seizures and induction of anti-asparaginase antibodies that inactivate the anti-cancer enzyme (Verma et al. 2007; Heinemann and Howard 1969; Savitri and Azmi 2003). To overcome the toxicity associated with preparations of asparaginase from the current sources, there is a need for identification of a new serologically different enzyme which has the same therapeutic effect. To obtain a better and alternative source of l-asparaginase, there is a huge ongoing interest to screen various organisms from various biodiversities.Fig. 1 Crystal structure of E. coli\nl-asparaginase (PDB ID: 1NNS)\n\n\n\nAlthough the l-asparaginase enzyme from guinea pig serum has no l-Glutaminase activity (Tower et al. 1963), bacterial l-asparaginase exhibits its activity with l-Gln as a substrate (Campbell and Mashburn 1969; Campbell et al. 1967; Howard and Carpenter 1972; Roberts et al. 1972; Tosa et al. 1972; Wriston Jr 1971). These two activities have been studied in E. coli enzyme preparations (Campbell and Mashburn 1969; Miller and Balis 1969). Upon treating patients of ALL with l-asparaginase, a marked depletion in both extracellular and intracellular glutamine has been observed both in vitro (Bussolati et al. 1995; Uggeri et al. 1995) and in vivo (Ollenschläger et al. 1988; Reinert et al. 2006; Rudman et al. 1971). In many tissues, a severe metabolic stress is caused by Glutamine starvation and is followed by the up-regulation of the expression and/or activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) that obtains glutamine from glutamate and ammonium (Lacoste et al. 1982). Treatment with the anti-tumor enzyme produces a marked increase in GS expression and a stimulation of GS activity. Moreover, in the same cells the inhibition of GS activity abolishes resistance to the cytotoxic effects of asparaginase leading to massive cell death. In those cells that are poorly sensitive to the anti-tumor enzyme, the effects of asparaginase are significantly enhanced by GS inhibition (Tardito et al. 2007). This laid the platform for this current study to understand the molecular information about the enzyme and its interactions with the substrates through docking and testing the stability of the enzyme and docked complexes under physiological conditions by molecular dynamics and simulations methods.\n\nMaterials and methods\nPreparation of ligands and receptor\nLigand molecules l-Asn (C4H8N2O3) and l-Gln (C5H10N2O3) whose molecular masses are 132.12 and 146.14 g/mol were retrieved from Zinc database with ID numbers 1532556 and 1532526, respectively. Then they were subjected for energy minimization using the MMFF (Merck Molecular Force Field) (Halgren 1996) of VLifeMDS v 4.3 that works based on MM3 force fields until reaching global minima. Crystal structure of l-asparaginase II from E. coli was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB: 1NNS) (Sanches et al. 2003).\n\nMolecular docking using Hex 8.0.0, PatchDock and FireDock\nHex is a rigid-body docking tool for use with large molecules such as DNA and proteins. Assuming the ligand is rigid, it computes protein ligand docking using Spherical Polar Fourier (SPF) correlations to accumulate the calculations (Sridhar et al. 2005). Global docking score can be obtained as a function of the six degrees of freedom in rigid-body docking, by scripting expressions for the overlay of pairs of parametric functions (Ritchie 2003; Ritchie and Kemp 2000). The docking score was obtained using the default parameters, and the same was interpreted as interaction energy between the ligand and receptor.\n\nIn order to verify the results obtained by Hex, another molecular docking was performed by Patch Dock server by submitting the structures to web server (Schneidman-Duhovny et al. 2005) that works based on shape complementarity principles and again the outcomes were refined with FireDock server (Andrusier et al. 2007; Mashiach et al. 2008) that reshuffles the interface side chains and amends the molecule’s relative orientation. Analysis of ligand binding interactions and docking viability was done based on Fire Dock scores and visualized using Pymol.\n\nMolecular dynamics and simulations\nMD simulations were executed for the apo enzyme, 1NNS—l-Asn (complex 1) and 1NNS—l-Gln (complex 2) docked complexes gained from molecular docking to ratify the stability for anti-cancer enzyme in apo state and bound state with the substrates in dynamic system. Generating both the l-Asn and l-Gln topologies using PRODRG server is the early step in MD simulations (Schüttelkopf and Van Aalten 2004). After defining ligand topologies, MD simulation for apo enzyme and docked complexes was carried using GROMACS 4.6.5 program package under Ubuntu 14.04 operating system. Steepest algorithm using the OPLS force field (Lindahl et al. 2001) was used for energy minimization, dismissing the step when the maximum force is found lesser than 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−1. To provide an aqueous environment in a system of a cubic box with a size of 1.0 nm and at least 2.0 nm between any two periodic protein images, all the molecules were solvated. With the addition of six Sodium ions, the system was neutralized and periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions. The cubic interpolation order in Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) simulation method is 4 and the grid spacing for FFT (Fourier spacing) is 0.16. In the neighbor searching method, the short-range neighbor list cutoff of 1 Å is taken commonly for electrostatic interactions and van der Waal interactions. The LINCS (Hess et al. 1997) and SETTLE algorithms (Miyamoto and Kollman 1992) were applied to constrain all bond lengths and geometry of water molecules, respectively, in the system. For 100 ps duration, the two equilibration phases, NVT ensemble with a constant temperature of 300 K, coupling constant of 0.1 ps, and NPT ensemble with constant pressure of 1 bar, coupling constant of 2 ps, were applied for all the molecules. Modified Berendsen thermostat coupling scheme algorithm was employed for both ensembles of equilibration. Once the system equilibration with constant temperature and pressure is done, a 30 ns production MD run was performed to carry out the structural and energy analyses. Run trajectories were obtained and quality assurance of all the molecules was done with GROMACS utilities, namely g_energy, g_rms, g_rmsf and g_gyrate. Hydrogen bonding analysis was done by g_hbond. Using XMGRACE tool, the entire trajectory results were analyzed (Turner 2005).\n\nResults and discussion\nAs per the structural description provided by the depositors a total of nine α-helices (54–59; 85–98; 114–124; 147–159; 248–255; 273–284; 308–311; 321–331 and 338–345) and fourteen β-sheets (25–32; 69–78; 104–108; 131–134; 169–172; 175–178; 182–184; 193–195; 202–205; 208–211; 236–240; 260–265; 288–293 and 313–315) are present in it. Based on interpro analysis (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/), N-terminus of 1NNS has two conserved threonine residues with catalytic role.\n\nDocking with l-asparagine and l-glutamine\nTwo ligand substrates namely l-Asn and l-Gln were docked into the catalytic site of 1NNS. Dock runs of ligands on the enzyme were performed using HEX 8.0.0 and PatchDock.\n\nWhen docking runs were carried out by HEX 8.0.0, 1NNS showed very high binding affinity (i.e., high E total value) with l-Asn and l-Gln resulting in less free energy of −160.89 and −165.60 kJ/mol, respectively. Results obtained by HEX were validated by PatchDock webserver followed by refinement of obtained results with FireDock server. Outcomes strongly supported the previous results with a very good binding efficiency between receptor and ligands with the calculated global energy values of −22.72 and −21.46 kcal/mol for l-Asn and l-Gln, respectively, (this value is considered to be related to free binding energy) by FireDock server. Enzyme made inter molecular hydrogen bonds (shown in red color) with ILE-182, ASN-184 with l-Asn ligand and on the other side generated same inter molecular hydrogen bonds with ARG-116, SER-120, and ASP-152 when l-Gln as the ligand (Table 1). A summary of the binding energies by all the docking methods is described in Table 2. The mode of binding and cavity of ligands with receptor was investigated in PyMol molecular graphics viewer (Fig. 2). Crosschecking of the 1NNS binding sites in docking was done with active site prediction tool FT Site (Ngan et al. 2012; Brenke et al. 2009). The pooled results exhibited matching of most of the residues and thus the binding sites used in docking approach were well-defined (Refer to Online Resource 1). Present investigation results reveal that the nearly equal affinity of Elspar® toward both the ligands strongly supports the asparaginase and glutaminase activities of the enzyme (Keating et al. 1993; Derst et al. 2000). Numerous adverse effects of l-asparaginase usage have also been stated, distant from severe immunogenic reactions (Kwon et al. 2009).Table 1 Molecular docking results of 1NNS with ligand substrates\n\nS.

The total energy found from g_energy results for apo enzyme, complex 1 and complex 2 was found to be −1,652,980, −1,805,840, and −1,806,110 kJ/mol, respectively, demonstrating that the models were energetically firm (Fig. 3). The structural convergence comprises terms like Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), and Radius of Gyration (Rg). The g_rms based results with backbone atoms (Fig. 4) exhibited initial equilibration up to 5.5 ns and the structure underway to converge later and achieved stability with a RMSD between 0.2 and 0.5 nm with a peak after 26 ns for 1NNS in apo state, whereas the docked complex 1 attained equilibration at 10 ns. After the initial equilibration, it was stable throughout the trajectory oscillating between RMSD values of 0.4 and 0.5 nm which were a little higher than apo state enzyme. Although complex 2 initially followed apo state enzyme, it achieved a stable conformation throughout the simulation soon after the first 4 ns with an average backbone RMSD between 0.26 and 0.42 nm. By showing much higher consistency throughout the entire trajectory, docked complex 2 confirmed its stable conformation over both the apo state enzyme and complex 1. The examination of g_rmsf results presented the oscillations with Cα atoms with respect to residues. Results of g-rmsf analysis revealed a few fluxes in Cα atoms with respect to apo enzyme residues. As per RMSF plot residues of complex 1 are stable (Fig. 5a) with a few peaks with RMSF value of more than 0.25 nm compared to complex 2 (Fig. 5b) where many residues are oscillating around 0.3 nm along with one high peak at the last one with 0.4 nm. The comparison of RMSF outcomes showed minor variations in ligand binding sites (Table 3) and their effect on complex formation. Radius of gyration (Rg) describes overall spread of molecule and was calculated using g_gyrate tool of GROMACS. Continuous drifts in gyration radii for apo state enzyme in the range of nearly 2.9 and 3.15 nm describe the dynamic nature of 1NNS. Docked complexes are better in terms of conformational stability with constant and low Rg values authorizing their better folding (Fig. 6) than unbound enzyme. Complex 1 was stable during entire MD run after 13 ns with no further drifts till end, and the second complex was stable only after 6 ns. The hydrogen bonding interactions between the docked complexes confirmed the hydrogen bonding pattern throughout 30 ns simulations (Fig. 7). Inter-hydrogen bond interactions pattern was clearly explained by the binding of l-Asn (Fig. 7a) and l-Gln (Fig. 7b) in the apo state initially with more number of hydrogen bonds which were reduced to 2–3 after the change in conformation due to binding after 12 ns simulations. Although MD simulation results were well correlated with molecular docking results with two to five hydrogen bonds seen in the dynamic state, surprisingly loss of hydrogen bonds at the end of simulations for complex 1 was observed. Overall, hydrogen bonding interactions revealed the affinity of ligand molecules with E. colil-asparaginase and its dual activity. An overall result from this computational study confirms the dual functionality of the E. colil-asparaginase enzyme. The instability of the enzyme upon the interaction with the ligand substrates based on RMSD, RMSF, and H-bond analysis suggests the need for identifying a new and stable l-asparaginase enzyme from diverse source with similar therapeutic effects for better curing of ALL.Fig. 3 Total energy of apo state 1NNS and its docked complexes\n\nFig. 4 RMSD plots of backbone atoms during 30 ns simulations\n\nFig. 5 RMSF of Cα atoms along with RMSF of Cα atoms a 1NNS apo enzyme and 1NNS + l-Asn. b 1NNS apo enzyme and 1NNS + l-Gln\n\nTable 3 Comparison of RMSF values from MD simulations\n\nS. no.\tResidue\tRMSF (nm)\t\n1NNS in apo state\tComplex 1\tComplex 2\t\n1\tARG116\t0.0875\t–\t0.1016\t\n2\tSER120\t0.0902\t–\t0.1305\t\n3\tASP152\t0.1667\t–\t0.1568\t\n4\tILE182\t0.1372\t0.1295\t–\t\n5\tASN184\t0.1684\t0.2356\t–\t\nFig. 6 Radius of gyration plot during 30 ns simulations\n\nFig. 7 Inter-hydrogen bonding for docked complexes\n\n\n\nConclusion\nl-asparaginase is one of the most attractive enzymes in cancer research. Investigational studies on E. coli sustained it as one of the therapeutic agents for ALL. In the present computational study, ligand binding pattern on 1NNS with l-Asn and l-Gln using molecular docking explained the binding mechanism at molecular level. Binding cavities and the key residues in binding were identified based on the docking results. MD simulations of complex 1 for 30 ns run confirmed the kinship of l-Asn in the dynamic system with less stability than complex 2. Overall findings strongly supported the bi-functional nature of the enzyme drug. Many conformational changes were observed with 1NNS structure due to the ligand binding. Results of this in silico studies favor added extensive structural research on l-asparaginase toward scheming of potential inhibitors that can be used in effective treatment of ALL.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (PDF 284 kb)\n\n \n\nAuthors would like to thank Director, National Institute of Technology Warangal, Warangal, India, for the kind support in bringing out the above literature and providing lab facilities.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nAuthors have no conflict of interest regarding the publication of paper.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAndrusier N  Nussinov R  Wolfson HJ   FireDock: fast interaction refinement in molecular docking Proteins Struct Funct Bioinform 2007 69 139 159 10.1002/prot.21495 \nBrenke R    Fragment-based identification of druggable ‘hot spots’ of proteins using Fourier domain correlation techniques Bioinformatics 2009 25 621 627 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp036 19176554 \nBussolati O  Belletti S  Uggeri J  Gatti R  Orlandini G  Dall’Asta V  Gazzola GC   Characterization of apoptotic phenomena induced by treatment with l -asparaginase in NIH3T3 cells Exp Cell Res 1995 220 283 291 10.1006/excr.1995.1317 7556435 \nCampbell HA  Mashburn LT   L-Asparaginase EC-2 from Escherichia coli.

The strain could metabolize 10 g/l chicken feathers as sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Soluble protein, amino acid, and cysteine content were found to be maximum (690.6 ± 8.7, 688.9 ± 9.12 and 21 ± 0.36 µg/ml, respectively) at late logarithmic phase of growth. Protease and keratinase activity reached its maximum level (103.26 ± 7.09 and 178.5 ± 9.10 U/ml) at the 4th day of incubation. The feather protein hydrolysate (FPH) obtained after degradation of chicken feathers was utilized to reduce hexavalent chromium. About 78.4 ± 2.4 and 63.6 ± 2.2 % reduction of 50 and 100 mg/l Cr(VI), respectively, was observed after 60 min of incubation with FPH. Further, there was no effect of autoclaved FPH on Cr(VI) reduction indicating that any bacterial enzyme was not involved in reduction process. Cr(VI) reduction was significantly inhibited by 10 mm Hg2+ ions indicating the role of sulfur-containing amino acids in reduction process. FTIR analysis confirmed that chromium reduction occurred due to oxidation of amino acids cysteine and cystine. This study shows that FPH arising after feather degradation can be employed as a potential candidate for the reduction of hexavalant chromium.\n\nKeywords\nStenotrophomonas maltophilia KB13Feather degradationFeather protein hydrolysateCr(VI) reductionAu3Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalayaissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nFeathers are considered as a potent waste generated in large amount by various poultry industries around the world. Feathers consist largely of insoluble protein keratin, which contains high degree of cross linking by disulfide bonds, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions (Jeong et al. 2010). These interactions present in keratin make it highly recalcitrant in nature and its accumulation creates serious environmental concern. Various physical and chemical treatments are employed in efficient degradation of feathers, but these processes are mostly energy consuming and the resulting feather lysates are deficient in heat-sensitive amino acids such as methionine, lysine, and tryptophan (Tiwary and Gupta 2010). The hydrolysis of feathers by keratinolytic microorganisms represents alternative method to reduce energy loss and environmental pollution load (Fang et al. 2013).\n\nVarious bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi are known to produce keratinolytic enzymes to degrade keratin and to metabolize it as carbon and nitrogen source (Tiwary and Gupta 2010). Most researches on microbial keratinases have been reported on Gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptomyces spp. (Tatineni et al. 2008; Syed et al. 2009) and Bacillus spp. (Lateef et al. 2010; Shrinivas and Naik 2011). However, some Gram-negative bacteria, such as Chryseobacterium sp. (Riffel et al. 2007), Aeromonas hydrophila K12, Stenotrophomonas maltophia (Yamamura et al. 2002; Jeong et al. 2010; Fang et al. 2013), Serratia marcescens P3 (Bach et al. 2012), and Pseudomonas stutzeri (Chaturvedi et al. 2014) have also been described as efficient keratin-degrading strains. All these microorganisms metabolize feathers as a source of carbon and nitrogen and release high amounts of free amino acids/short peptides in the culture medium (Yamamura et al. 2002). These are collectively termed as feather protein hydrolysates (FPH) and can be utilized as slow-release nitrogen fertilizers (Lasekan et al. 2013), antioxidants (Fontoura et al. 2005) or for production of glutathione (Taskin 2013), Exopolysaccharides (Taskin et al. 2012), Biohydrogen (Bálint et al. 2005). The presence of high amounts of free amino acids also makes it a good reducing agent. However, this property has not been much explored.\n\nHexavalent chromium is employed in industries such as leather tanning, metallurgy, electroplating (Ataabadi et al. 2015), petroleum refining, textile manufacturing, etc. (Allegretti et al. 2006) and, therefore, huge amounts of chromium are being discharged in the environment. Chromium exists in two oxidation states, Cr(VI) and Cr(III), where Cr(VI) is highly toxic to plants, animals, and humans. Cr(VI) has high solubility and thus is mobile in soils and ground water and whereby it gains entry into plants and animals and elicits acute toxicity. In contrast, Cr(III) precipitates as Cr(OH)3 under alkaline or weak acidic conditions; thus it is less mobile and toxic (Chen et al. 2007). Therefore, reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is considered as an efficient method for chromium removal and to reduce its toxicity in environment (Megharaj et al. 2003). Studies have shown that chromium can be reduced by various chemical and biological methods. Adsorption (Santhana et al. 2014), Chemicals such as ferrous [Fe(II)] compounds (Ren et al. 2013), Anion exchange resins (Deng et al. 2010), Electrolysis (Welch et al. 2005), etc. can efficiently reduce chromium compounds (Wang et al. 2012). However, these compounds are chemically synthesized, costly, and also not safe. Biological method involves use of microbes and their enzymes, which reduce chromium VI to chromium III (Thatoi et al. 2014). Several microorganisms such as Exiguobacterium sp. (Alam and Malik 2008), Ochrobacterium intermedium (Sultan and Hasnain 2007), Stenotrophomonasmaltophilia, Pantoea sp., and Aeromonas sp. (Alam and Ahmad 2012) have been shown to reduce hexavalent chromium.\n\nIn the present investigation, a strain of S. maltophia KB13 was utilized to metabolize chicken feathers as sole source of carbon and nitrogen. FPH arising after degradation of chicken feathers by this isolate was used to reduce hexavalent chromium. This is the first report showing potential use of FPH as an inexpensive source for chromium removal.\n\nMaterials and methods\nMaterials\nFeathers were procured from regional poultry farm of Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, India, washed extensively with tap water, dried at 60 °C for 2 days, and then kept at room temperature until used. All chemicals and other reagents were of pure grade and purchased from Sigma chemicals, India.\n\nPreparation of media and culture condition\nBacterial strain was grown on feather meal broth (FMB) containing (g/l) K2HPO4 0.4, KH2PO4 0.3, NaCl 0.5, chicken feathers 10 (Tatineni et al. 2008). pH was adjusted to 7.5 before sterilization. For subculturing and storing, Feather Meal Agar (FMA) was employed, which contained (g/l) K2HPO4 0.3, KH2PO4 0.4, NaCl 0.5, MgCl2.6H2O 0.1, and feather 10 and agar 15. Peptone water was employed for inoculums preparation containing (g/l) peptone 10, and NaCl 5 (pH 7.4). All cultivation media were autoclaved at 121 °C, 105 kPa for 15 min.\n\nIsolation of feather degrading bacterial strain and phylogenetic analysis\nFeather-degrading bacteria were isolated employing enrichment technique. Soil samples were collected from feather disposal site of Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh. One gram (1 g) of soil was suspended in 0.9 % saline solution and vortexed for 2–3 min intermittently. The supernatant was inoculated in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml FMB supplemented with 10 g/l chicken feathers as sole source of carbon and nitrogen. The inoculated flask was kept for incubation at 32 °C and 150 rpm in rotator shaker (Remi, CIS-24 BL) for 3 days. Five milliliter (5 ml) culture suspension was transferred subsequently to 50 ml of fresh FMB and incubated for 3 days at 32 °C. The suspension was serially diluted; 100 µl of suspension was spread on FMA and was incubated at 32 °C for 48 h. The morphologically distinct colony of bacterial cells was individually inoculated on fresh FMB and incubated at same condition mentioned above for 3 days. Feather degradation potential of each stain was assessed by estimating soluble protein content of supernatant (Bradford 1976) and by measuring residual feather content. The isolate exhibiting highest soluble protein content and least amount of residual feather was considered as potential feather degrading strain and selected for further study.\n\nThe selected strain was characterized by physiological and biochemical parameters as described in Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (9th edition) (Holt et al. 1994). Identification of this strain was performed by partial gene sequencing of 16S rDNA commercially (Chromous Biotech Pvt. Ltd) by primers 27 F (AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG) and 518 R (GTA TTA CCG CGG CTG CTG G). The sequence was submitted to genbank NCBI for retrieval of accession number.\n\nTime course study of feather degradation\nA single colony of strain KB13 was inoculated in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of peptone water and incubated at 35 °C and 125 rpm in an orbital shaker. After overnight growth, the culture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min (Remi C-24 BL). The cell pellet was washed twice and suspended in 5 ml FMB (without feathers). Five percent (v/v) inoculums (3 × 108 CFU ml−1) were added to 100 ml of FMB (containing 10 g/l chicken feather) and incubated at the same conditions. Samples (2 ml) were retrieved from each of triplicate cultures every 24 h to evaluate growth, soluble protein production, and enzyme activity. Triplicate assays were performed for each parameter.\n\nEstimation of growth\nGrowth was estimated using TTC reduction method and absorption was measured at 480 nm (De Logu et al. 2001). Briefly, to 1 ml of culture suspension 10 µl of 0.02 % TTC solution was added and was incubated at 32 °C for 30 min. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was discarded and 1 ml of 95 % ethanol was added to the cell pellet and kept for shaking (150 rpm) at 32 °C and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance of supernatant was recorded at 480 nm. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford method (1976) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. The absorbance was determined spectrophotometrically at 590 nm using UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu). Total amino acid content was measured by manual ninhydrin method by taking leucine as standard (Cheng et al. 2010).\n\nEnzyme assay\nKeratinase assay was performed according to the method of Anbu et al. (2007) with minor modifications. Twenty mg (20 mg) of chopped feathers was suspended in 3.8 ml of 100 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0) followed by addition of 200 µl of culture supernatant to it. This preparation was incubated at 50 °C and 120 rpm for 1 h and the reaction was stopped by cooling the tubes in ice chilled water. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min, the absorbance of supernatant was measured at 280 nm. Control samples were prepared in a similar manner except that the enzyme was replaced by same volume of 100 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0). One unit of enzyme activity was considered as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 µmol/min of tyrosine. Similarly, protease activity was determined with the above mentioned conditions using casein as the substrate.\n\nEstimation of cysteine content\nCysteine content was estimated by Ellman’s reagent (Ellman 1959). To 250 µl of standard cysteine solution, 2.5 ml of phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.2) and 50 µl of Ellman’s reagent were added. The solution was vortexed and incubated at room temperature of 15 min. The absorbance was recorded at 412 nm. For estimation of cysteine in chicken feather hydrolysate, 250 µl of chicken feather hydrolysate obtained from (48 h old culture) was taken instead of standard cysteine solution, and the rest of steps were same as mentioned.\n\nReduction of hexavalent chromium\nTo 1 ml of chicken feather hydrolysate, 50, 100 mg/l chromium(VI) was maintained by adding different volumes of potassium dichromate stock solution (1 mg/ml). The solution was incubated for 1 h and then residual chromium(VI) was estimated by carbazide reagent. In control, 50, 100 mg/l chromium(VI) was prepared in double-distilled water. To study the reduction of hexavalent chromium by cysteine and methionine different concentration of these amino acids (10–50 ppm) was prepared in double-distilled water and employed for chromium reduction assay. Similarly, the FPH was concentrated twice using lyophilizer (Mac HC 333, India) and was used to study chromium reduction. To study the role bacteria in reduction process, strain KB 13 was grown for 48 h in FMB (without chicken feathers) supplemented with glucose (1 g/l) and NH4Cl (1 g/l), respectively. After 48 h of growth the culture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The culture supernatant was filtered through Whatman filter paper No.1 and supernatant was used for reduction assay as mentioned above.\n\nEstimation of hexavalent chromium\nHexavalent chromium was estimated as per the method of Eaton et al. (2005). To 1 ml of potassium dichromate solution, 200 µl of 1 M sulfuric acid and 500 µl of carbazide reagent were added and incubated for 30 min. The absorbance of solution was recorded at 540 nm. In control 1 ml double-distilled water was used. To prepare carbazide reagent, to 0.05 g 1, 5 diphenyl carbazide, 2 ml glacial acetic acid was added. The final volume was maintained 25 ml by adding double-distilled water. The carbazide reagent was stored at 4 °C until use.\n\nDetermination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\nMIC was evaluated by growing the strain in nutrient broth supplemented with different concentrations of hexavalent chromium (10–50 ppm) at 32 °C for 48 h. The minimum concentration of chromium at which no growth was observed was considered as the MIC of strain.\n\nFTIR analysis\nFor FTIR analysis, potassium dichromate was treated with FPH. Final concentration was maintained at 50 mg/l. After 1 h of treatment the sample was dried in vacuum drier. Feather protein hydrolysate was taken as control. The samples were mixed with spectroscopically pure KBr in ration of 5:95 (sample: KBr). Pellets were fixed in sample holder and analysis was carried out using Shimadzu 8400 FTIR spectrometer.\n\nResults and discussion\nEight potential keratinolytic strains were isolated from soil samples collected from feather disposal site on the basis of enrichment technique in minimal medium containing chicken feathers (10 g/l) as sole carbon and nitrogen source. Strain KB13 was found to be the potent keratinolytic strain and only 13.8 % residual feather remained in the medium after 4 days of incubation. The strain KB13 was a Gram-negative, rod-shaped motile bacterium. 16S rDNA analysis revealed its 97 % similarity with S. maltophilia strain SSASC23 on BLAST search at NCBI. The strain was identified as S. maltophilia strain KB13 (Accession No. KC818432.1). This is in accordance with previous reports, indicating that S. maltophilia can metabolize chicken feathers Yamamura et al. (2002), Jeong et al. (2010) and Fang et al. (2013).\n\nThe time course study of feather degradation was performed in feather meal broth containing 10 g/l feather as sole source of carbon and nitrogen. The level of soluble protein and amino acid content showed a gradual increase and reached its maximum (690.6 ± 8.7 and 688.9 ± 9.12 µg/ml) at late logarithmic phase of growth (Fig. 1a). Maximum cysteine content in FPH was 21 ± 0.36 µg/ml during this period (Fig. 1b). Feather degradation process usually starts from feather barbs and progresses with the degradation of feather rachis (Chaturvedi et al. 2014). In the present study feather degradation by the strain of S. maltophilia KB13 exhibited a similar trend. Keratinase and protease activity reached the maximum level (103.26 ± 7.09 and 178.5 ± 9.10 U/ml) on the 4th day of cultivation (Fig. 1c). These results were consistent with those of previous reports (Jeong et al. 2010; Chaturvedi et al. 2014).Fig. 1 Time course study of growth and feather degradation by S. maltophilia KB13 on FMB supplemented with 10 g/l chicken feathers, incubated at 120 rpm, 30 °C. Time course study of a growth and soluble protein production, b amino acid and cysteine production, c protease and keratinase activity. The result is represented as mean ± standard error of three independent variables\n\n\n\nReports have shown that free amino acids such as cysteine, methionine, and cystine can reduce hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium. Kwong and Pennington (1983) demonstrated that l-cysteine can reduce hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium according to reaction. HCrO4-+2L-CysSH→L-Cystine+HCrO3- \n\nIn another study by Adari et al. (2008), it was observed that l-cystine can also reduce chromium(VI) to Chromium(III) according to the reaction. 3cystine+10Cr(VI)→6cysteicacid+10Cr(III) \n\nChicken feather hydrolysate contained high amounts of cysteine, cystine and, therefore, can be utilized for reduction of hexavalent chromium. The FPH produced at late logarithmic phase of growth after degradation of chicken feathers was employed for reduction of hexavalent chromium. In the present study, significant reduction of chromium(VI) was observed after incubation of chicken feather hydrolysate with 50 and 100 mg/l chromium(VI) for 1 h (Fig. 2a). It was also observed that the rate of reduction of 50 mg/l chromium(VI) was higher than 100 mg/l concentration. This might be due to the fact that the concentration of amino acids was limiting at higher concentration of chromium(VI). To confirm this hypothesis, FPH was concentrated twice and was employed for chromium reduction. It was observed that in the presence of FPH, reduction of hexavalent chromium was 58 ± 5.2 % and in the presence of concentrated FPH reduction was 87 ± 4.2 %. This result clearly shows that amino acids play a role in reduction of hexavalent chromium. As the amount of amino acids increases due to concentration of FPH, the rate of chromium reduction has also substantially increased. Tsopmo et al. (2014) have also previously described the reduction of hexavalent chromium by digested oat bran protein and role of cysteine in reduction process. Since, reduction of hexavalent chromium has also been reported by S. maltophilia (Alam and Ahmad 2012). Therefore, strain KB13 was grown for 48 h in minimal medium, the culture supernatant was used to reduce hexavalent chromium. The result showed that no reduction of chromium was observed. Further Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of this isolate towards hexavalent chromium was calculated. MIC was found to be 40 ppm, which indicated that this strain was sensitive towards chromium. The characters of microorganisms are closely related to habitats to which they belong. S. maltophilia ZA-6 was recovered from soil irrigated with tannery effluents containing high amounts of chromium (Alam and Ahmad 2012) which enabled the bacterium to resist and reduce hexavalent chromium. As strain KB13 was isolated from a feather disposal site and not from the chromium-rich soil, it was able to metabolize chicken feathers but was sensitive to chromium. To further rule out the role of any bacterial enzyme in reduction process, the hydrolysate was autoclaved at 121 °C at 15 atm pressure for 20 min. It was cooled at RT and chromium oxidation assay was performed. It was observed that at a concentration of 50 mg/l chromium(VI), the rate of reduction was slightly higher in autoclaved feather hydrolysate as compared to un-autoclaved samples (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2 Feather protein hydrolysate mediated reduction of hexavalent chromium (a) reduction of 50 and 100 mg/l chromium(VI) after 30 and 60 min. b Reduction of 50 mg/l chromium(VI) through autoclaved and unautoclaved feather hydrolysate (c) reduction of 50 and 100 mg/l chromium(VI) in the presence of 5 mM and 10 mM Hg2+ concentration\n\n\n\nSince concentration of amino acids vary considerably in FPH, reduction of 50 mg/l hexavalent chromium was performed with varying concentrations of cysteine and methionine, respectively (Fig. 3). A dose-dependent relationship was observed with chromium reduction and concentration of amino acid: with an increase in concentration of amino acid an increase in chromium reduction was observed. However, the reduction was low as compared to that observed in FPH. Since FPH contains a mixture of amino acids, reduction takes place by combined action of these amino acids and higher reduction was observed. Quievryn et al. (2001) have reported that glutathione and cysteine are main reducers of hexavalent chromium in humans exposed to high concentration of chromium. In this study, hexavalent chromium was reduced to chromium(III). We proposed that a similar mechanism is involved in reduction of hexavalent chromium by FPH. Since concentration of cysteine in FPH is very high (21 ± 0.36 µg/ml), high amount of hexavalent chromium (50 and 100 mg/l) was reduced.Fig. 3 Reduction of 50 mg/l hexavalent chromium in the presence of varying concentrations of cysteine and methionine, respectively, after 1 h of incubation\n\n\n\nTo further confirm this hypothesis, chromium reduction was studied in the presence of Hg2+ ions, since Hg2+ ions are considered as potent inhibitor of sulfur-containing amino acids such as cysteine, cystine, and methionine, respectively. Hg2+ irreversibly binds to these amino acids and inhibits their activity (Focardi et al. 2012). To further confirm the role of these amino acids in reduction of hexavalent chromium, 5 and 10 mM concentration of Hg2+ ions were added to FPH and chromium reduction was estimated (Fig. 2c). It was observed that in the presence of 5 mm Hg2+ ions, 36.5 ± 1.4 and 62.3 ± 2.3 % inhibition in chromium reduction at 50 and 100 mg/l chromium(VI) was observed. Similarly, in the presence of 10 mM Hg2+ ions, 86.4 ± 2.4 and 93.2 ± 3.5 % inhibition in chromium reduction at 50 and 100 mg/l chromium(VI) was observed. This result clearly demonstrates the role of sulfur-containing amino acids in reduction of hexavalent chromium.\n\nTo further confirm the role of amino acid cysteine in reduction of hexavalent chromium, FTIR analysis of feather protein lysate and feather protein lysate containing 50 mg/l potassium dichromate was performed. The FTIR spectrum is depicted in Fig. 4. The FTIR spectrum of feather protein lysate showed peaks between 570 and 705 cm−1, i.e. at 472.56, 551.64 cm−1 corresponding to S–S stretching of disulfide bond (Lo et al. 2012). In feather hydrolysate-containing chromium, these peaks were absent and a new peaks at 1608.63, 1521.84, 1506.41, and 1029.99 cm−1 corresponding to S=O bond present in cysteic acid were observed. This confirms that chromium reduction is taking place due to oxidation of cysteine to cystine and then to cysteic acid. The findings of this study are consistent with previous reports (Adari et al. 2008).Fig. 4 FTIR spectrum of feather protein hydrolysate (red) and Cr(VI) treated feather hydrolysate (green) presented the chemical groups involved in Cr(VI) reduction process\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this study, feather degradation by S. maltophilia KB13 has shown to be an efficient and ecofriendly approach to reduce the accumulation of feathers in the environment. The FPH obtained after degradation of chicken feather could be efficiently utilized for the reduction of chromium. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that sulfur-containing amino acids such as cysteine and cysteine were solely responsible for the reduction process and that no bacterial enzyme was involved. This is the first report showing the potential use of FPH as an inexpensive source for chromium removal.\n\nThis work was supported by Department of Biotechnology, Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, India.

These are grouped in multiple glycoside hydrolase families based on their catalytic and sequence characteristics. Most studies carried out on β-glucosidases are focused on their industrial applications rather than their endogenous function in the target organisms. β-Glucosidases performed many functions in bacteria as they are components of large complexes called cellulosomes and are responsible for the hydrolysis of short chain oligosaccharides and cellobiose. In plants, β-glucosidases are involved in processes like formation of required intermediates for cell wall lignification, degradation of endosperm’s cell wall during germination and in plant defense against biotic stresses. Mammalian β-glucosidases are thought to play roles in metabolism of glycolipids and dietary glucosides, and signaling functions. These enzymes have diverse biotechnological applications in food, surfactant, biofuel, and agricultural industries. The search for novel and improved β-glucosidase is still continued to fulfills demand of an industrially suitable enzyme. In this review, a comprehensive overview on detailed functional roles of β-glucosidases in different organisms, their industrial applications, and recent cloning and expression studies with biochemical characterization of such enzymes is presented for the better understanding and efficient use of diverse β-glucosidases.\n\nKeywords\nβ-GlucosidasesGlycoside hydrolaseCellulosomeGlucosidesCellulaseissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nβ-Glucosidases (β-d-glucopyrranoside glucohydrolase) [E.C.3.2.1.21] are the enzymes which hydrolyze the glycosidic bond of a carbohydrate moiety to release nonreducing terminal glycosyl residues, glycoside and oligosaccharides (Bhatia et al. 2002; Morant et al. 2008; Cairns and Esen 2010; Li et al. 2013). These enzymes are present in all kinds of organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, and play several important roles such as biomass conversion in microorganisms, breakdown of glycolipids and process of lignification, involve in defense against pests, phytohormones activation, catabolism of cell wall in plants and both plant–microbes and plant–insects interaction. β-Glucosidase also plays an important role in the treatment of Gaucher’s disease (resulting from a deficiency of β-glucosidase) in which accumulation of glycoceramides takes place in the lysosomal tissues (Butters 2007). β-Glucosidases are the essential part of cellulase system (cellulose metabolizing enzymes) and catalyze the last and final step in cellulose hydrolysis. Cellulase enzymes hydrolyze the cellulose to produce cellobiose and other short oligosaccharides which are finally hydrolyzed to glucose by β-glucosidase. All the enzymes, which are involved in cellulose hydrolysis, are normally grouped as cellulase system (Fig. 1). It consists of the following enzymes: endoglucanase (endo-1, 4–β-glucanase [E.C.3.2.1.4]), exoglucanase (cellobiohydrolase) (exo-1, 4-β-glucanase [E.C.3.2.1.91]) and β-glucosidase (β-d-glucoside glycohydrolase [E.C.3.2.1.21]) (Teeri 1997). The endoglucanase randomly hydrolyzes the β–1–4 bonds in the middle portion of cellulose molecule and the exoglucanase acts at reducing and non-reducing ends to release the cellobiose and other oligosaccharides. Finally, these oligosaccharides are converted to glucose by β-glucosidase (Bhat and Bhat 1997).Fig. 1 Diagrammatic overview of cellulose metabolism by cellulase system: during cellulose hydrolysis, cellulase along with exo and endoglucanase acts on the cellulosic fibers and hydrolyzed it into the smaller sized oligosaccharides. These smaller molecules are finally utilized by β-glucosidase as a substrate to release glucose as the final product of complete hydrolysis of cellulosic substance\n\n\n\nβ-Glucosidases are widely used in the various biotechnological processes, including the production of biofuel and ethanol from cellulosic agricultural wastes and synthesis of useful β-glucosides (Li et al. 2013). These enzymes are employed in industry for hydrolysis of bitter compounds during juice extraction and liberation of aroma from wine grapes (Gueguen et al. 1998; Harhangi et al. 2002). In flavor industry, β-glucosidases are the key enzymes in the enzymatic release of aromatic compounds from glucosidic precursors present in fruits and fermenting products (Krisch et al. 2010). Also, this has large potential for application in food processing industries and used as a flavor enzyme to enhance the flavor of wine, tea and fruit juice (Keerti et al. 2014). β-Glucosidases play an important role in flavor liberation from glucosylated (β-glucosides conjugated) precursors in fruits and other plant tissues (Krisch et al. 2010). Cleavage of phenolic and phytoestrogen glucosides from fruits and vegetables is also carried out by applying this enzyme to extract medicinally important compounds and to enhance the quality of beverages (Schroder et al. 2014). β-Glucosidases hydrolyzed anthocyanine products, i.e., anthocyanidins and sugar aglycones are less soluble than anthocyanines, possess little colour, tend to precipitate and can be removed more easily. β-Glucosidases can improve the organoleptic properties of citrus fruits and juices in which bitterness is in part due to a glucosidic compound, naringin whose hydrolysis requires in succession, an α-rhamnosidase and a β-glucosidase (Riou et al. 1998). β-Glucosidases have been the subject of recent research due to the key role of these enzymes in biological processes and for many biotechnological applications. In present review, we briefly explain the generalized action mechanisms of β-glucosidase enzymes, their functional role in different types of organisms and significant contribution in different industries along with a brief look on the current research for improving the efficiency of this industrially important enzyme.\n\nTypes of β-glucosidases and their classification\nβ-Glucosidases are common among plants, fungi and bacteria, and showed an identical similarity with respect to their sequences and structures. They can be classified on the basis of their substrate activity or their nucleotide sequence identity. Based on substrate specificity, β-glucosidases are grouped into three classes: (i) aryl-β-D-glucosidases (having strong affinity for aryl-β-D-glucosides), (ii) cellobiases (hydrolyze only disaccharides) and (iii) broad specificity glucosidases (exhibit activity on many substrate types and are the most commonly found β-glucosidases) (Rajan et al. 2004). On the basis of sequence homology, β-glucosidases have been divided into two sub-families (i) BGA (β-glucosidases and phospho-β-glucosidases from bacteria to mammals) and (ii) BGB (β-glucosidases from yeasts, molds and rumen bacteria) (Cantarel et al. 2009; Krisch et al. 2010). An alternative classification system for glycoside hydrolases based on amino acid sequence and structural similarity has also been developed (Henrissat and Davies 1997). In this system, those enzymes with overall amino acid sequence similarity and well-conserved sequence motifs are considered in a single family. At present, 133 glycoside hydrolase (GH) families are listed in the frequently updated Carbohydrate Active enZYme (CAZY) website (http://www.cazy.org) (Cantarel et al. 2009; Cairns and Esen 2010). These families are further classified into clans. The families with similar catalytic domain structures and conserved catalytic amino acids, suggestive of a common ancestry and catalytic mechanism, are grouped under the same clan. Clan GH-A contains largest number of families including β-glucosidase containing families GH1, GH5 and GH30. Largest number of characterized β-glucosidases belongs to GH1 family. Family GH1 includes β-glucosidases from archaebacteria, plants and mammals, and family GH3 comprises β-glucosidases of some bacterial, mold and yeast origin (Cairns and Esen 2010; Krisch et al. 2010).\n\nInternational Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) classified GH families into the structurally determined families (Henrissat and Davies 1997; Harris et al. 2010). This family classification based on the structural features of the enzymes is more informative than substrate specificity because the complete range of substrates is very difficult to determine for individual enzymes. The structural features of a family can be used to study the structures of other members of the same family by applying some bioinformatics tools and system biology approach. Tertiary structure, particularly at the active site, dictates the enzyme mechanism and their substrate specificity. The family classification also explains the evolution of the glycoside hydrolases (Lynd et al. 2002). A classical (β/α)8 barrel Folds as a key feature of GH1 family β-glucosidase was reported in X-ray crystallographic structure of β-glucosidase BGL1A from a basidiomycete (Phanerochaete chrysosporium) by Nijikken et al. (2007). Structure of human cytosolic β-glucosidase was also illustrated by X-ray crystallography and reported the existence of the same (β/α)8 barrel (Tribolo et al. 2007).\n\nCatalytic mechanism of β-glucosidases\nFor elucidating the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and the active site topology, several techniques such as pH-dependence, inhibition, isotopic effect, and structure–reactivity studies (Kempton and Withers 1992), essential amino acid labeling with fluorosugars (Withers et al. 1992), reactions with deoxy substrate analogues (Street et al. 1992), and site-directed mutagenesis (Wang et al. 1995) have been used. β-Glucosidases cleave β-glycosidic bonds between two or more carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety (http://www.cazy.org/Glycoside-Hydrolases.html). Most β-glucosidases that have been characterized (i.e., GH1, GH3 and GH30 family enzymes) are retaining enzymes, and they perform catalysis in two steps, glycosylation and deglycosylation. Their catalytic mechanism is described diagrammatically in Fig. 2. Glutamate is the key active site residue and conserved among all reported β-glucosidases (Davies and Henrissat 1995; Wang et al. 1995). Two glutamate residues performed the overall catalytic reaction of β-glucosidase and one of them acts as a nucleophile (conserved as ‘I/VTENG’ motif) and the second residue works as a general acid/base catalyst (conserved as a ‘TFNEP’ motif) (Davies and Henrissat 1995). In the initial (glycosylation) step, glutamate, which acts as nucleophile, undergoes a nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon and results in a glucose–enzyme intermediate product. In the second (deglycosylation) step, a water molecule, which is activated by acid/base catalyst glutamate residue, acts as a nucleophile and breaks the glycosidic bond to release glucose (Litzinger et al. 2010). The formation of the covalent intermediate was first demonstrated with the GH1 β-glucosidase from Agrobacterium sp. by covalent labeling with 2, 4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucoside (Withers et al. 1987, 1990). Tribolo et al. (2007) have reported X-ray crystallographic structure of human cytosolic β-glucosidase with the pocket shaped active site containing two glutamate residues and formed by large surface loops, surrounding the C termini of the barrel of β-strands. Out of two catalytic glutamate residues, the acid/base catalyzing residue was located on strand 4 while the nucleophilic residue was located on strand 7.Fig. 2 Proposed “retaining” mechanism for hydrolysis of β-glycosidic bond by β-glucosidase: (1) during first glycosylation step, a conserved glutamate residue acts as nucleophile and attacks on the glycosidic bonds or cellobiose and other oligosaccharides formed by the hydrolytic action of other enzyme of cellulase system. This results into the formation of an enzyme-substrate intermediate complex, (2) during second step called deglycosylation, an another conserved glutamate residue activates a water molecule present in the proximity by general acid/base catalyst reaction and now this activated water molecule acts on the intermediate complex to release the free glucose residue\n\n\n\nβ-Glucosidases from GH9 family use an inverting mechanism, in which an activated water molecule makes a direct nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon to displace the aglycone in a single step (Qi et al. 2008). The catalytic base extracts a proton from the incoming water molecule while the catalytic acid protonates the leaving group aglycone.\n\nFunctional roles of β-glucosidases in different organisms\nEnzymes are the biocatalysts and involved in almost all biological processes. β-Glucosidases are kind of enzymes which regulate both synthesis as well as breakdown process and involved in many essential bioconversions in all kinds of life forms. The roles of β-glucosidases in different organisms are discussed briefly in following sections.\n\nIn microorganisms\nMicroorganisms are one of the simplest and primitive life systems evolved in our planet. Many studies have been carried out on microorganisms with respect to β-glucosidases but most of them are focused on their industrial application rather than their endogenous function in the target microorganisms. β-Glucosidases are reported in all forms of microorganisms such as bacteria (Isorna et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2010a; Verma et al. 2013), archea (Park et al. 2007; Cobucci-Ponzano et al. 2010; Li et al. 2013; Schroder et al. 2014) and fungi (Krisch et al. 2010; Sorensen et al. 2013). Archaea are considered as best source for industrially suitable enzymes due to their functional stability in higher temperature which is useful for their utilization in industrial operations (Li et al. 2013). These enzymes play important roles in some fundamental biological processes such as in degradation of cellulose and other carbohydrates for nutrient up-take, cell wall mechanism, host–pathogen, and symbiotic association. β-Glucosidases enable phytopathogenic fungi to colonize their host plant tissues by hydrolyzing toxic glucosides to less toxic or less soluble aglycone (Collins et al. 2007). Bacterial β-glucosidases are components of large complexes called cellulosomes, contain polysaccharide degrading endoglucanases and carbohydrate binding proteins to localize the complex and to the cellulose surface and the cell membrane. In bacteria and fungi, β-glucosidases are mainly a part of the cellulase enzyme system and are responsible for the hydrolysis of short chain oligosaccharides and cellobiose (resulting from the synergistic action of endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases) into glucose in a rate-limiting step (Isorna et al. 2007). It was found that the enzyme activity of cellulose-degrading enzymes decreases as the glucose chain length increases (Bhatia et al. 2002).\n\nThe principal role of β-glucosidase in cellulolytic microorganisms is to catalyze the hydrolysis of cellobiose and cello-oligosaccharides, producing glucose during bioconversion. These soluble substrates of β-glucosidase are produced from insoluble cellulose by the action of other members of the cellulose system of enzymes (Doi and Kosugi 2004). β-Glucosidase is a useful enzyme from soil microbes and contributes in maintenances of soil quality because of its central role in soil organic matter cycling (Turner et al. 2002). They are also involved in host–pathogen and symbiotic relationships as they catalyze the breaking through plant cell walls to establish pathogenic or symbiotic relationships (Gilbert et al. 2008).\n\nIn plants\nIn plants, β-glucosidases performed many functions. Morant et al. (2008) explain the involvement of β-glucosidases in plant metabolisms. These are involved in many key processes such as formation of required intermediates for cell wall lignification (Escamilla-Trevino et al. 2006), degradation of endosperm’s cell wall during germination (Leah et al. 1995), in indole alkaloid biosynthesis (Barleben et al. 2005) activation of plant hormones (Lee et al. 2006; Verma et al. 2011), Cyanogenesis (release of toxic cyanide) (Zagrobelny et al. 2004) and in plant defense against biotic stresses (Jones et al. 2000). Plants contain defense glycosides in non-active form which are activated by the action of β-glucosidase enzymes and released as toxic compounds (Jones and Vogt 2001; Knudsen 2014). In general, the defense glycosides are stored in a different cell or a different cellular compartment from the β-glucosidases that hydrolyze them to release toxic compounds. The defense compounds tend to be stored in the vacuole, while their corresponding β-glucosidases are often found in the apoplast or plastid (Zagrobelny et al. 2008). Verdoucq et al. (2004) studied a plant β-glucosidase which plays important role in plant defense against pests. These enzymes cleave specific β-glucosides to release toxic aglycone moieties. In Lotus japonicas, β-glucosidase catalyzes the bioactivation of hydroxynitrile glucosides which provide the strength against herbivores and pathogens (Morant et al. 2008; Knudsen 2014). The family 1 β-glucosidase enzyme of Sorghum biocolor (Dhr1) has shown a strict specificity for its natural substrate dhurrin. While, maize β-glucosidase (Glu1), which shares 70 % sequence identity with Dhr1, hydrolase a broad spectrum of substrate in addition to its natural substrate 2-O-β-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxaxin-3-one. Sherameti et al. (2008) observed that β-glucosidase-mediated defenses are also required for endophytic fungi to develop symbiotic relationships with plants, evidently by modulating the growth of these microorganisms. β-Glucosidases appear to play roles in both the degradation of oligosaccharides presented in cell wall and release of monolignols from their glycosides to allow lignification to stabilize secondary cell walls (Kuntothom et al. 2009). These enzymes also play essential roles in plant’s secondary metabolisms. The monoterpene alkaloid intermediate is hydrolyzed by a specific β-glucosidase to allow metabolism to various monoterpene alkaloids, depending on the plant (Barleben et al. 2007). β-Glucosidases could play metabolic roles to release glucosyl blocking groups from metabolic intermediates and allow metabolism to various natural products, many of which are of medicinal importance (Nomura et al. 2008).\n\nIn mammals\nMammals contain several β-glucosidases, including the family GH1 lactase-phloridzin hydrolase and cytoplasmic β-glucosidase, the GH30 human acid β-glucosidase (GBA1) and the bile acid β-glucosidase or GBA2. These enzymes are thought to play roles in metabolism of glycolipids and dietary glucosides. In addition, a group of related family GH1 proteins is thought to play signaling functions. Currently, five GH1 proteins are known in humans: lactase-phloridzin hydrolase (LPH), cytoplasmic β-glucosidase, Klotho (α-Klotho, KL) β-Klotho (β-KL), and Klotho-LPH-related protein (KLPH). LPH, an intestinal hydrolase involved in food digestion, has both β-glucosidase activity toward exogenous glucosides, such as phloridzin, and β-galactosidase activity toward lactose (Arribas et al. 2000). Perhaps the best-studied mammalian β-glucosidase is the human acid β-glucosidase, which is generally considered a glucosyl ceramidase. Defects in the function of this enzyme and its transport to the lysosome lead to Gaucher’s disease, in which glycoceramides accumulate in the lysosomes of tissue leukocytes leading to their swelling (Butters 2007). Mammalian cytosolic β-glucosidase from liver cells also has ability to hydrolyze many common dietary xenobiotics, including glycosides of phytoestrogens, flavonoids, simple phenolics and cyanogens, and prevents from their hazardous effect (Hays et al. 1998; Berrin et al. 2002). Such kind of cytosolic β-glucosidase was also reported from small intestine, spleen and kidney (Berrin et al. 2002). Takagi et al. (1999) reported a β-glucocerebrosidase, a kind of β-glucosidase in mammalian stratum corneum which has a role in lipid distribution during membrane structural maturation and epidermal homeostasis.\n\nIn insects and other animals\nThe insect β-glucosidase has both merits and demerits: these are the main enzymes used for converting wood-cellulose to glucose for biofuel production and can also be an important part of the mechanism which leads to serious damage to wood structures, landscaping trees and many agricultural crops (Zhang et al. 2012). Due to these twofold implications, β-glucosidase from insect origin is a concern of several ongoing studies to enhance the cellulose degradation and development of cellulase-specific inhibitors as termiticides for insect and pest control (Yapi et al. 2009). For these purposes, a lot of insects such as silkworm (Bombyx mori) (Byeon et al. 2005), Reticulitermes flaviceps (Xue et al. 2008), palm weevil (Rhynchophorus palmarum) (Yapi et al. 2009), termite (Reticulitermes santonensis) (Matteotti et al. 2011), cockroach (Periplaneta americana) (Koffi et al. 2012), red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) (Riseh et al. 2012) and higher termites (Bujang et al. 2014) have been studied for the isolation and characterization of an efficient β-glucosidase.\n\nDrosophila melanogaster genome contains only one GH1 gene, suggesting that insects may not synthesize this gene family at an early stage, other insects have adapted glycosides and glycoside hydrolases from the plants on which they feed for protection and digestive purposes. These genes have since evolved to provide help for the unique needs of the herbivorous insects in their battle with plant defenses to utilize the plant nutrients. A few digestive β-glycosidases from GH1 have been isolated from insect larvae that feed on plant. The larval β-glycosidases can hydrolyze gluco-oligosaccharides and plant glycosides, such as cellobiose, gentiobiose and amygdalin (Marana et al. 2001). β-Glucosidase was also reported in the gut contents of the snail (Achatina achatina) (Umezurike 1976).\n\nIsolation, cloning and expression studies for production of efficient and novel β-glucosidase\nTo obtain an improved enzyme, researchers have adopted several approaches like heterogeneous expression of β-glucosidase genes from different sources (Byeon et al. 2005; Chan et al. 2011; Aftab et al. 2012), characterization of immobilized enzyme in several agents (Keerti et al. 2014) and side-directed mutagenesis to enhance the efficacy of enzymes (Wang et al. 1995; Liu et al. 2011; Agrawal et al. 2012). Cloning and expression in suitable host for bulk production of β-glucosidase enzyme is one of the primitive concerns about ongoing research on β-glucosidase. Cloned enzyme also exhibits some advantages such as showing high isoflavone glucoside-hydrolyzing activity (Kuo and Lee 2007), more resistant to glucose inhibition (Jabbour et al. 2012), and more efficient for solid state fermentation (Krisch et al. 2010). Several β-glucosidases have been cloned from bacteria, yeast, fungi, plant and animal sources with the intent of producing this enzyme on a large scale for various biotechnological applications (Collins et al. 2007; Chang et al. 2011; Aftab et al. 2012). For expression of β-glucosidase, different kind of host organisms including Pichia pastoris, Trichoderma reesei and E. coli species were used (Harhangi et al. 2002; Murray et al. 2004; Chang et al. 2011). For β-glucosidase gene cloning studies, following three strategies have been used: first, formation of a genomic DNA library followed by selection of the clones by screening for β-glucosidase production; Second, starting with a cDNA library (or a genomic library), screening of recombinant clones by specific nucleotide probes designed from a knowledge of the polypeptide sequence; and third strategy is primer designing of existing gene sequence and PCR based cloning of gene (Bhatia et al. 2002). A detailed account of properties of heterogeneously expressed β-glucosidases from various bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and plant sources is given in Table 1.Table 1 Characteristics of heterogeneously expressed β-glucosidases isolated from different types of organisms\n\nType of organism\tSource organism\tExpression host\tMol.

Recently, the increased demand of energy has strongly stimulated the research on the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into reducing sugars for the subsequent ethanol production. β-Glucosidases have been the focus because of their important roles in a variety of fundamental biological processes and the synthesis of useful β-glucosides. Although the β-glucosidases of different sources have been investigated, the amounts of β-glucosidases are insufficient for effective conversion of cellulose.\n\nThe cellulolytic fungal β-glucosidases have also been the subject of numerous investigations by various research groups (Murray et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2012a). The fungal enzymes are used in several biotechnological processes, including development of novel carbohydrate foods, alcohol-based fuels and other commercial products from cellulose (Krisch et al. 2010). Liu et al. (2012a) isolated a thermostable native β-glucosidase from the lignocellulose-decomposing fungus Aspergillus fumigatus Z5. Furthermore, when it was added to lignocellulosic materials, the release of phenolic compounds increased, indicating that cellulose-degrading enzymes may also be involved in the breakdown of polymeric phenolic compounds.\n\nβ-Glucosidase in ethanol and biofuel production\nThe increased energy consumption demand and the depletion of fossil resources have laid the foundation for a shift towards sustainable production of biofuels (Sorensen et al. 2013). The use of plant biomass in the form of dedicated energy crops or cellulosic agricultural waste as an abundant and inexpensive material for biofuel is one of the current focus of industrial as well as research aspect. Most bioconversion is focused on the production of a sugar platform of simple sugars which can then biologically or chemically be converted into fuels (e.g., ethanol, butanol and hydrocarbons) (Cherubini 2010). Recently, Li et al. (2014) cloned and characterized a β-glucosidase from rumen microbes of cattle feeding with Miscanthus sinensis and this plant is used as an ideal source of biofuel. Coating of β-glucosidase on polymer nanofibers was also found more efficient for cellulosic ethanol production (Lee et al. 2010). β-Glucosidases as part of the cellulase enzyme complex hydrolyze cellobiose and cello-oligosaccharides to yield glucose which is fermentable by yeasts into fuel ethanol. Ethanol production from cellulose is performed via the degradation of cellulose to cello-oligosaccharides and glucose, followed by the conversion of glucose to ethanol by microorganisms (Kotaka et al. 2008). The cellulose is degraded by endoglucanases and exoglucanases, producing cellobiose and some cello-oligosaccharides, which can be converted to glucose by β-glucosidase. The reaction catalyzed by β-glucosidase is the most important step in the degradation of cellulose because it limits the efficiency of hydrolysis and could relieve the cellobiose-mediated inhibition of exoglucanase and endoglucanase (Zhenming et al. 2009). Liu et al. (2012b) reported a yeast strain Clavispora NRRL Y-50464 that is able to utilize cellobiose as sole source of carbon and produce β-glucosidase enzyme activity for cellulosic ethanol production. It was also observed that this yeast was tolerant to the major inhibitors derived from lignocellulosic biomass pre-treatment such as 2-furaldehyde (furfural) and 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde (HMF), and converted furfural into furan methanol in less than 12 h and HMF into furan-2,5-dimethanol within 24 h in the presence of 15 mM each of furfural and HMF. The ethanol production of 23 g/l was obtained without addition of exogenous β-glucosidase by this strain. However, the most widely used cellulase from Trichoderma viridae has a poor β-glucosidase activity and the accumulation of cellobiose will lead to product inhibition. Addition of thermo-tolerant β-glucosidases to commercial cellulase enzyme preparations resulted in synergistic effect and increased reducing sugar concentration (Krisch et al. 2010).\n\nEthanol producing bacteria have attracted much attention because their growth rate is higher than that of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is normally used for commercial production of fuel alcohol and to make industrial ethanol production more economical. Yanase et al. (2005) carried out his research work on Zymomonas mobilis, an ethanol producing bacterium. It has been observed that Zymomonas mobilis showed high growth rate and high specific ethanol production, which makes it an attractive candidate for industrial ethanol production, but its narrow spectrum of fermentable carbohydrates reduced its use for fuel ethanol production. To overcome from this limitation, genetic manipulation in β-glucosidase gene was used to expand the range of its carbohydrate substrates which lead to production of 0.49 g ethanol/g cellobiose by recombinant strain. Some of the recent studies focused on the use of microbial β-glucosidase for biofuel production from cellulosic waste are listed in Table 2.Table 2 Recent studies on the isolation, cloning and characterization of β-glucosidase for ethanol production from cellulosic materials\n\nMicroorganism type\tName of organisms\tTotal ethanol production\tReferences\t\nBacteria\t\nExiguobacterium oxidotolerans\n\t–\tChen et al.

The natural process by endogenous plant β-glucosidases is very time consuming. Supplementation with efficient external enzymes may enhance aroma release (Gueguen et al. 1998). Monoterpenols in grapes (e.g., linalol, geraniol, nerol, citronclol, α-terpineol and Iinalol oxide) are linked to diglucosides, which contribute to the flavor of wine (Gunata et al. 1994). The enzymatic hydrolysis of these compounds requires a sequential reaction, which produce monoglucosides. Subsequently, monoglucosides are hydrolyzed by the action of β-glucosidases. The addition of glucose-tolerant exogenous β-glucosidase isolated from fungi (e.g., A. oryzae) was shown to improve the hydrolysis of glucoconjugated aromatic compounds and enhance wine quality (Riou et al. 1998). Sestelo et al. (2004) isolated and characterized β-glucosidase from wine strain of Lactobacillus plantarum which also performs the lactic acid fermentation and culminated need of applying additional enzymes to release flavorous compounds. Recently, Gonzalez-Pombo et al. (2011) isolated and characterized an extracellular β-glucosidase from Issatchenkia terricola to study the efficiency of immobilized enzyme to enhance the aroma flavor of white Muscat wine. In tea beverage industries, use of β-glucosidase enhances the content of essential oils (Krisch et al. 2010). In one report, Su et al. (2010) used an immobilized β-glucosidase to increase the essential oil content from 6.79 to 20.69 %. In citrus fruit juices, the hydrolysis of naringenin by β-glucosidase found to be reducing the bitterness of the juices (Fan et al. 2011a).\n\nβ-Glucosidase in soy-based foods\nSoyabean is a part of many foods and drink products and soy contains many glucosidic isoflavones like daidzin, genistin and glycitin. However, in soy-based foods the isoflavones are mainly in the inactive form of glycosides which can be hydrolyzed by applying additional β-glucosidase enzyme to convert them into aglycones (daidzein, genistein and glycitein) (Hati et al. 2015). Aglycone forms of isoflavones exhibit higher biological activity than their glucosidic forms and also absorbed faster in higher amounts during digestion (Izumi et al. 2000). Isoflavones found in soybean exhibit phytoestrogenic properties and are useful in treatment and prevention of various diseases such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis (Rimbach et al. 2008), prostate cancer and breast cancer (Liggins et al. 2000), relieve in menopause symptoms (Levis et al. 2010), estrogenic and antioxidant activity (Liu et al. 2010). In soy milk, the aglycon content was increased significantly either by treatment with β-glucosidase or by fermentation with a β-glucosidase producing Lactobacillus strain (Marazza et al. 2009). In the food industry, the application of gellan, an exopolysaccharide produced by Sphingomonas paucimobilis, is very limited because of its high viscosity and low solubility. Therefore, hydrolytic activity of β-glucosidases may be useful in the production of low-viscosity gellan foods. β-Glucosidases are also associated with removal of bitterness from citrus fruit juices (Roitner et al. 1984).\n\nβ-Glucosidase in flavor industry\nβ-Glucosidases are widely used in the flavor improvement industry. Many hundreds of different β-glucosidic flavor precursors found in plants, and their hydrolysis by β-glucosidases enhance the quality of the beverages and foods produced from them. β-Glucosidases are key enzymes in the release of aromatic compounds from glucosidic precursors present in fruits and fermentating products (Schroder et al. 2014). β-Glucosidases can also be used to improve the organoleptic properties of citrus fruit juices, in which it reduced the bitterness that is due to a glucosidic compound, naringin (4,5,7-trihydroxyflavanone-7-rhamnoglucoside) (Roitner et al. 1984; Keerti et al. 2014). After treatment of β-glucosidases, the reduction of fruit bitterness or gellan hydrolysis leads to the reduction in viscosity of fruit juice was also observed (Schroder et al. 2014). Recently, Keerti et al. (2014) have isolated and characterized a thermostable β-glucosidase from Bacillus subtilis and applied it to enhance the quality of sugarcane juice after immobilizing it into alginate beads.\n\nOther applications of β-glucosidase\nβ-Glucosidases are used for the synthesis of oligosaccharides and alkyl-glycosides (Bankova et al. 2006). Oligosaccharides can be used as therapeutic agents, diagnostic tools and growth promoting agent. They have important functions in biological systems including fertilization, embryogenesis and cell proliferation. Alkyl-glycosides are nonionic surfactants with high biodegradability and also have antimicrobial properties. Hence, they have potential application in pharmaceutical, chemical, cosmetic, food and detergent industries as these can be hydrolyzed by β-glucosidase (Bankova et al. 2006). Enzymes from the source plants or other sources may be added to foods and beverages before, during, or after processing to enhance food quality. Thus, β-glucosidases with desirable properties may be focused for plant breeding programs, tissue culture and recombinant technologies to increase their overproduction in transgenic microbial or plant hosts and their catalytic properties for flavor enhancement and stability.\n\nAside from flavor enhancement, foods, feeds and beverages may be improved nutritionally by release of vitamins, antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from their glycosides. Opassiri et al. (2004) studied that vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can be released from pyridoxine glucoside by β-glucosidase in rice. Other vitamins are also found as glucosides in different plants and release of their aglycones may improve their nutritional availability. This enzyme is also able to hydrolyze anthocyanins producing anthocyanidins and sugars. The resulting aglycones process little color and are less soluble than anthocyanins tend to precipitate and can be removed more easily. It is very much helpful in orange industry as it helps in color changing during pasteurization. β-Glucosidase supplementation was beneficial for single-stomached animals such as pigs and chickens in which cellulose degradation was enhanced by this enzyme leading to better nutrient utilization (Zhang et al. 1996).\n\nAs evident from previous sections, the wide functional implications and industrial applications of β-glucosidases make it a promising target for studies related to its higher production, novel enzyme, better stability, etc. Although β-glucosidases are having tremendous industrial demand but a suitable industrial β-glucosidase fulfilling all the desired properties is still lacking and studies are continued in anticipation of a novel enzyme with such properties.\n\nIn conclusion, an understanding of in vivo functional roles of these enzymes, biochemical properties, existing applications and well characterized heterogeneous expression technology discussed in this review will help in improvement of these enzymes using enzyme engineering and more relevant applications could be emerged in near future.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of

Compared with other natural sources such as plants, fungi are highly diverse but understudied. However, research on Cladosporium cladosporioides revealed the existence of bioactive products such as p-methylbenzoic acid, ergosterol peroxide (EP) and calphostin C as well as enzymes including pectin methylesterase (PME), polygalacturonase (PG) and chlorpyrifos hydrolase. p-Methylbenzoic acid has ability to synthesise 1,5-benzodiazepine and its derivatives, polyethylene terephthalate and eicosapentaenoic acid. EP has anticancer, antiangiogenic, antibacterial, anti-oxidative and immunosuppressive properties. Calphostin C inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) by inactivating both PKC-epsilon and PKC-alpha. In addition, calphostin C stimulates apoptosis in WEHI-231 cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. Based on the stimulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress in some types of cancer, calphostin C has also been evaluated as a potential photodynamic therapeutic agent. Methylesterase (PME) and PG have garnered attention because of their usage in the food processing industry and significant physiological function in plants. Chlorpyrifos, a human, animal and plant toxin, can be degraded and eliminated by chlorpyrifos hydrolase.\n\nKeywords\nCalphostin (C)ChlorpyrifosCladosporium cladosporioidesErgosterol peroxide (EP)p-Methylbenzoic acidPectin methylesterase (PME)Polygalacturonase (PG)issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nThe genus Cladosporium, identified by Link for the first time in 1815, is characterised by the absence of a sexual proliferation phase; therefore, it is classified into the Fungi Imperfecti (Deuteromycota) group. This genus belongs to the mitosporic Ascomycotic phylum, subphylum Pezizomycota, class Dothideomycetes, family Mycosphaerellaceae and contains approximately 500 species (De Hoog et al. 1995; Okada et al. 1996). Cladosporium, species are most frequently found in outdoor and indoor environments, spoiled organic matter and are considered as food important contaminants (Dixon and Polak-Wyss 1991; De Hoog et al. 2000; San-Martin et al. 2005). Additionally, some Cladosporium spp. can develop even on the surface of glass fibres and inside water pipes (Macher 1999; Johanning 1999). These fungi can utilise different growth substrates, such as, wood plants, dead plants, food, soil, straw and textiles (Tasić and Miladinović-Tasić 2007). Several species of this genus have been associated with fish diseases (Otto 2000). The common ancestor has been identified for only 15 species of Cladosporium. The most isolated species are Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Cladosporium herbarum and Cladosporium elatum (De Hoog et al. 1995; Masclaux et al. 1995). In contrast, many species of Cladosporium are also able to produce some secondary metabolites such as, antibiotics which are inhibitors of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans (Gallo et al. 2004). Furthermore, some Cladosporium species are efficient biological insecticides, particularly against insects that have developed resistance to chemical insecticides (Abdel-Baky and Abdel-Salam 2003).\n\nCladosporium cladosporioides normally grows on potato-dextrose agar (PDA) medium and generates one-celled conidia (spores). It is recognised by the formation of 3-cm diameter colonies, which are either (the colonies are either) olive-green or brown basal side (Krogh 1989; Tasić and Miladinović-Tasić 2007). In this review, we critically summarise the medical and industrial usage of bioactive compounds and enzymes derived from C. cladosporioides.\n\nBioactive metabolites from Cladosporium cladosporioides\np-Methylbenzoic acid\np-Methylbenzoic acid (Fig. 1), known as p-toluic acid, was extracted from C. cladosporioides an isolate from marine sponge and later identified using spectroscopic methods (San-Martin et al. 2005). p-Methylbenzoic acid promotes the synthesis of 1,5-benzodiazepine and its derivatives, which are active compounds against diverse targets such as interleukin converting enzymes (ICE), potassium blockers (Ik) and peptide hormones (CCK) (Herpin et al. 2000; Varala et al. 2007). Benzodiazepines are widely used as antianxiety, anticonvulsant, anti-depressive, anti-inflammatory agents, analgesics and sedatives (Tsoleridis et al. 2008). Benzodiazepines have a variety of activities including antiulcer, antileukaemic, vasopressin antagonist, antiplatelet and endothelial antagonist and relief of skeletal muscle joint pain (Kumar and Joshi 2007; Aasth et al. 2013). Benzodiazepines are also used as fibre dyes and are used to produce fused ring compounds such as oxadiazolo-, triazolo-, oxazino- or furano benzodiazepines (Wu et al. 2006; Aasth et al. 2013). Initially used to yield polyethylene terephthalate (PET) via condensation polymerisation with ethylene glycol, p-methylbenzoic acid is an intermediate in the production of terephthalic acid (Speight 1999). PET is widely used commercially and has one of the highest manufactured tonnages of all polymer products in the world (Jankauskaitė et al. 2008). PET is used to produce fabrics, fibres and textiles. In addition, PET has progressively dominated the bottle market for bottled water and carbonated soft drinks as well as food containers and packaging materials. These days, PET is increasingly being used to produce fibre strengthened composite (Giles and Bain 2001; Vakili and Fard 2010).Fig. 1 p-Toluic acid structure\n\n\n\nBased on studies, Shirasaka et al. (2005) demonstrated that p-methylbenzoic affect fatty acid composition by increasing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) production. EPA, a (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), serves as the phospholipid acyl group in membrane-bound organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. EPA contributes to membrane organisation, cell division and resistance to oxidative stress at low temperatures in psychrophiles and marine bacteria (Nishida et al. 2006; Okuyama et al. 2007; Kawamoto et al. 2009).\n\nConsuming EPA, one of the primary v-3 fatty acids in fish oils, has been demonstrated to be beneficial in several experimental and clinical studies. A standard dose of EPA inhibits tumour growth-induced lipolysis and muscle protein degradation, possibly by suppressing the cytokine IL-6 and reducing a tumour-specific product that is a proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) EPA improved prolonged survival, enhanced weight maintenance, ameliorated food intake and reduced protein degradation without effecting protein synthesis. These observations indicate that EPA may be useful for the clinical management of malignancy patients (Beck et al. 1991; Babcock et al. 2000a). The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that patients suffering from heart diseases such as coronary heart disease should supplement their diet with (1 g) EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) daily. The AHA also recommends that healthy adults consume one serving of fish at least two times per week (Manhiani et al. 2009). Anti-inflammatory activity has specifically been demonstrated for EPA, but not for all v-3 fatty acids. However, regioisomeric mixtures of EPA and epoxydocosapentaenoic acid (EDP) appear to be highly efficient for reducing inflammatory pain (Beck et al. 1991; Inceoglu et al. 2011). Doses of 1.25–2.5 g/kg body weight have been observed to produce the optimal effect when using EPA (Babcock et al. 2000b).\n\nErgosterol peroxide (EP)\nErgosterol peroxide (EP) (Fig. 2), a bioactive compound, has been extracted from C. cladosporioides obtained from a marine sponge using spectroscopic methods (San-Martin et al. 2005). EP isolated from C. cladosporioides has not been examined against various types of diseases. However, EP isolated from different organisms ranging from fungi to plants has been reported to have anticancer, antiangiogenic, antibacterial, anti-oxidative and immunosuppressive properties (Rhee et al. 2012). EP, known as pro-vitamin D2, contributes to the prevention of colon and prostate cancer (Kobori et al. 2007). EP inhibits phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), TPA-induced inflammation and tumour promotion in mice (Kobori et al. 2007). EP also inhibits the growth of certain cancer cells, stimulates apoptosis in HL60 human leukaemia cells, reduces lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes and represses the production of mitogen stimulated mouse and human lymphocytes (Yasukawa et al. 1994; Fujimoto et al. 1994; Bok et al. 1999; Yaoita et al. 2002; Guyton et al. 2003; Kuo et al. 2003; Takei et al. 2005; Prompiboon et al. 2008).Fig. 2 Ergosterol peroxide (EP) structure\n\n\n\nAccording to Rhee et al. (2012), nontoxic concentrations of EP suppress the DNA-binding activity, phosphorylation, nuclear trans-localisation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in U266 cells. EP inhibits the phosphorylation of the upstream kinase, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and other tyrosine kinase family members, i.e., Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). SHP-1 protein and mRNA levels are increased by EP; conversely, silencing the SHP-1 gene abrogates EP-mediated STAT3 inhibition (Rhee et al. 2012). Furthermore, cellular and protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a STAT3 target gene, are decreased by EP. Female BALB/c athymic nude mice inoculated with U266 cells have significantly reduced tumour growth when treated with EP (Rhee et al. 2012). Additionally, EP treatment reduced STAT3 and CD34 expression in tumours (Rhee et al. 2012). It has been demonstrated that EP suppresses LPS-induced inflammatory responses by inhibiting NF-kB and C/EBPb transcriptional activity and phosphorylation of MAP kinases (MAPKs) (Kobori et al. 2007). EP further suppresses cell growth and STAT1-mediated inflammatory responses by altering the redox status in HT29 cells (Kobori et al. 2007).\n\nEP is a highly efficient antimicrobial agent against the Gram-positive pyogenic bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, with an MIC value of 50 mg/ml (Huong et al. 2010; San-Martin et al. 2005). EP also exhibits cytotoxic activity against RD cancer cells with an IC50 of 4.6 mg/ml (Huong et al. 2010). Recent studies indicate oncogene and tumour suppressor gene expression is controlled by RNAs referred to as microRNAs (miRNAs) (Calin and Croce 2006; Lee et al. 2007). The expression of certain microRNAs (miRNAs) is increased in cancer and drug-resistant cells (Zheng et al. 2010). EP effectively stimulated death in miR-378 cells at low concentrations. Therefore, EP may be a promising novel therapeutic agent against drug-resistant tumour cell (Wu et al. 2012).\n\nCalphostin (C)\nCalphostin C (Fig. 3), isolated from C. cladosporioides culture broth, inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) by inactivating both PKC-epsilon [a Ca(2+)-independent novel isoform] and PKC-alpha [a Ca(2+)-dependent conventional isoform] and exhibits cytotoxic activity against various tumour cells (Rotenberg et al. 1995). A 500 nM calphostin C concentration was used to test a series of N-terminal-truncated bovine PKC-alpha mutants expressed in Saccharomyces. This concentration was active against proteins with up to 91 amino acid (aa) deletions from the amino terminus (ND91), while only 20 % inhibition occurred against a mutant protein truncated by 140 aa (ND140). Therefore, the amino acid (aa) sequence from 92 to 140 contains the structural element of PKC-alpha that is suppressed by calphostin C (Kobayashi et al. 1989; Rotenberg et al. 1995). Calphostin C reduces cancer cell lung colonisation and adherence to the endothelium for both high and low metastatic sub-populations at sub-micromolar IC50 concentrations (Liu et al. 1992). At a 3 µM concentration, calphostin C repressed ISO+ ionomycin-induced cAMP and cGMP accretion by 80 and 78 %, respectively (Ogiwara et al. 1998). The effects of calphostin C in vitro have been assessed using ɛ-peptide, ζ-peptide and Ac-MBP (4–14) as substrates (Ogiwara et al. 1998). The percent inhibition of Ac-MBP (4–14) phosphorylation was 58 % at a 1 µM calphostin C concentration. However, calphostin C reduced phosphorylation by 60 and 50 % when ɛ-peptide and ζ-peptide were used as substrates, respectively (Ogiwara et al. 1998).Fig. 3 Calphostin (C) structure\n\n\n\nWEHI-231 cells undergo apoptosis when calphostin C is used at a 250 nM concentration (Chmura et al. 1996). The addition of calphostin C led to increased ceramide production compared with baseline levels and a simultaneous decrease in sphingomyelin; therefore, calphostin C synergistically acted with exogenous ceramide analogues to induce apoptosis (Chmura et al. 1996). These findings imply that the relationship between PKC activity and ceramide is antagonistic to the signalling events prior to apoptosis (Chmura et al. 1996). Potent inhibitors of phospholipase (PLDs) have an anti-apoptotic effect in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); however, PLD activity is suppressed by calphostin C, resulting in VSMC apoptosis. Calphostin C also increases microtubule disturbances, suggesting that calphostin C may be used to destabilise microtubule networks. Consequently, calphostin C induces VSMC apoptosis by inhibiting PLD activity followed by microtubule polymerisation (Zheng et al. 2004). The earliest calphostin C effect is the destruction of glycoprotein export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), accompanied by ER-originated vacuole creation. Vacuolisation of the ER is associated with ER stress response induction, which includes the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, protein kinase R-like ER kinase and increased expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous transcription factor (CHOP; GADD153). These effects indicate that ER stress is the result of calphostin C interaction with targets other than PKC (Kaul and Maltese 2009). Cell sensitivity to calphostin C decreased when CHOP expression was reduced, suggesting that calphostin C apoptosis induction via ER stress is due to the interruption of ER morphology and transport function. Because calphostin C can elicit ER stress, it has been evaluated as a potential photodynamic therapy agent against certain cancers (Kaul and Maltese 2009).\n\nEnzymes secreted by Cladosporium cladosporioides\nPectin methylesterase (PME) and polygalacturonase (PG)\nThe pectinase enzymes PME and PG have been reported to be excreted by C. cladosporioides and were extracted using the Buescher and Furmanski procedure (Bastos et al. 2013). The ideal conditions to produce both PME and PG are after 10 days of incubation and precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 and benzoate buffer at pH 4.0 (Buescher and Furmanski 1978; Silva et al. 2008; Bastos et al. 2013). Pectinases, or pectinolytic enzymes, are found in plants, bacteria, insects and fungi and can be categorised into three main groups: pectinesterases, protopectinases and depolymerases. Pectin de-esterification catalysed by esterase enzymes leads to the removal of the metoxyl ester group. The degradation of insoluble protopectin is performed by protopectinases, resulting in highly polymerised soluble pectin. However, hydrolysis of the α (1 → 4) glycosidic linkage in pectic acid is catalysed by depolymerases (Whitaker et al. 2003; Jayani et al. 2005; Gonzalez and Rosso 2011). PME (EC 3.1.1.11) is responsible for pectin degradation by catalysing the demethoxylation of the homogalacturonan chain of pectin to release methanol and acidic pectin (Micheli 2001). Pectin is a primary component of plant cell walls; therefore, PME can affect the integrity and rigidity of plant tissues. PG catalyses the hydrolytic cleavage of the polygalacturonic acid chain via the introduction of water across the oxygen bridge, releasing galacturonic acid as the main product (Kluskens et al. 2005).\n\nRecently, pectinases have garnered attention due to their application in the food processing industry and critical role in plant physiology (Dixit et al. 2013). The main industrial purposes of pectinases are to extract and clarify fruit and vegetable juice (Alkorta et al. 1998). Pectin is responsible for the consistency and turbidity of juice, resulting in increased viscosity that prevents juice concentration, clarification and filtration. Pectin degradation is achieved by adding pectolytic enzymes leading to high juice yields by allowing additional clarification and filtering as well as reduced viscosity (Sarιoğlu et al. 2001; De Gregorio et al. 2002; Souza et al. 2003; Fernández-González et al. 2004; Ribeiro et al. 2010). Unicellular products, formed by the transformation of organised tissues into a suspension of intact cells, can be produced by pectinase enzymes (Kashyap et al. 2001). These products can be used in pulpy juices and nectars, baby foods, dairy products such as yogurt and puddings and protoplasts for diverse biotechnological applications (Kashyap et al. 2001). Vegetable oil extraction has been performed using pectinase enzymes. Oil yield and stability are improved after enzyme treatment and polyphenol and vitamin E content are increased, improving the oil’s organoleptic quality (Kashyap et al. 2001; Hoondal et al. 2002; Iconomou et al. 2010). Pectolytic microorganisms are also used to ferment coffee beans, a process that removes the mucilage layer from the beans (Avallone et al. 2002). For example, a commercial enzyme product containing pectinase is applied to coffee beans to initiate fermentation (Pasha et al. 2013). Significantly, fermentation time has been reduced by using pectinase enzymes (Amorim and Amorim 1977; Silva et al. 2000; Kashyap et al. 2001; Serrat et al. 2002). Chocolate flavour is developed by cocoa fermentation, which is performed using pectinolytic enzymes (Schwan and Wheals 2004; Ouattara et al. 2010). Tea leaf fermentation has been accelerated and facilitated by treatment with pectic enzymes at a dose adjusted to avoid leaf damage (Carr 1985; Kashyap et al. 2001). Pectolytic enzymes which have fungal origin facilitate the wine fermentation process and improve the quality and diversification of products (Sieiro et al. 2012). During the winemaking extraction process, pectic enzymes facilitate filtration and intensify wine flavour and colour (Sieiro et al. 2012).\n\nChlorpyrifos hydrolase\nBecause of its use as a broad spectrum insecticide, chlorpyrifos (O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl) phosphorothioate) has been widely restricted in some European countries and the United states as it is potentially toxic and persistent in the environment (Li et al. 2007; Bhagobaty et al. 2006). 3,5,6-Trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) is a metabolite released from chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl during degradation (Xu et al. 2008; Anwar et al. 2009; Li et al. 2010). These compounds can be transported through the atmosphere and water and may transfer into soils and sediments, resulting in diffuse pollution (Harms et al. 2011). Oliver et al. (1999) demonstrated that chlorpyrifos is harmful to the respiratory system, central nervous system, cardiovascular system and reproductive system because of its highly potent toxicity. Their study was conducted in the United States at Columbia University in 263 pregnant females who were exposed to approximately to the same level of contamination. An acute relationship was observed between prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos and low birth weight and smaller infant head size. Smaller head size is correlated with poor function and lower intelligence quotients (IQ). Chlorpyrifos’ toxic effects extend to diverse types of arthropods including ladybird beetles, bees and parasitic wasps (Lee et al. 2012). Chlorpyrifos also affects birds and fish, leading to reduced nestling weight and morphologic distortions for birds as well as death for both organisms (NCAP 2000). In plants, prolonged chlorpyrifos exposure leads to delayed seedling emergence, abnormal cell division and fruit malformation (Bhagobaty et al. 2006). Moreover, public attention to potential human health risks, from exposure to chlorpyrifos residue on food, has increased due to the frequent use of chlorpyrifos in agriculture (Cochran et al. 1995; Yu et al. 2006). Consequently, it is necessary to develop methods to degrade and eliminate chlorpyrifos from the environment. Although several bacterial isolates have demonstrated the ability to degrade chlorpyrifos, there is limited information regarding chlorpyrifos elimination by fungi (Singh et al. 2004; Li et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2008; Anwar et al. 2009). Fungi are responsible for the biogeochemical cycle and the degradation of hazardous materials in the biosphere (Liang et al. 2005). The first report concerning chlorpyrifos bioremediation using chlorpyrifos hydrolase produced in C. cladosporioides was performed by Gao et al. (2012).\n\nConclusion and future prospects\nFungi are one of the most important groups of organisms on the planet, therefore, additional research to better characterise fungi should be performed. Recognised as an important and novel resource for natural bioactive products, fungi have potential applications in various domains such as medicine, the food industry and agriculture. Recently, research has been oriented towards investigating novel, natural bioactive products derived from fungi because of the declining discovery rate of active novel chemical entities. C. cladosporioides has been poorly studied despite its rich bioactive compound content, production of several enzymes and decreased risk compared with other extensively studied fungi. To date, there is scarce information regarding the bioactive compounds and secreted enzymes present in C. cladosporioides. However, studies that have been conducted on C. cladosporioides discovered bioactive compounds including p-methylbenzoic acid, EP and calphostin C as well as enzymes such as PME, PG and chlorpyrifos hydrolase.\n\np-Methylbenzoic acid stimulates the synthesis of 1,5-benzodiazepine and its derivatives that possess beneficial human health effects. It also increases PET yield, which is used in synthetic fibres, beverage, food and liquid containers. p-Methylbenzoic acid enhances EPA production, which is present in membrane-bound organisms from bacteria to humans. EPA may also potentially be used in the clinical management of malignancy patients. Although EP has demonstrated anticancer, antiangiogenic, antibacterial, anti-oxidative and immunosuppressive properties, C. cladosporioides derived EP has not been studied against various types of diseases. Calphostin C, a known anticancer agent, inhibits PKC by inactivating both PKC-epsilon and PKC-alpha. Calphostin C induces apoptosis in WEHI-231 cells and VSMCs. Calphostin C has been evaluated as a potential photodynamic therapy agent because of its stimulation of ER stress in certain cancers. Methylesterase (PME) and PG are pectinase enzymes that have garnered attention because of their applications in the food processing industry and its critical role in plant physiology. Chlorpyrifos hydrolase has been demonstrated to efficiently degrade and eliminate chlorpyrifos from the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the focus of future research should be (1) investigating the optimal growth conditions for C. cladosporioides to produce high yields of p-methylbenzoic acid, EP and calphostin C along with chlorpyrifos hydrolase enzymes; (2) examining C. cladosporioides derived EP as a bioactive product against diverse types of diseases; (3) examining the anticancer activity of calphostin C in vivo; (4) characterising and completely purifying (PME) and PG; (5) characterising the molecular biology of the chlorpyrifos hydrolase gene and its regulatory mechanisms; and (6) identifying novel compounds and enzymes and examining those which exhibit biotechnological properties for use in medical and industrial applications.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nWe declare that we have no conflict of interest.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAasth AP  Navneet K  Anshu A  Pratima S  Dharma K   1,5 Benzodiazepines: overview of properties and synthetic aspects Res J Chem Sci 2013 3 90 103 \nAbdel-Baky N  Abdel-Salam A   Natural incidence of Cladosporium  spp. as a bio-control agent against whiteflies and aphids in Egypt J Appl Entomol 2003 127 228 235 10.1046/j.1439-0418.2003.00662.x \nAlkorta I  Garbisu C  Llama MJ  Serra JL   Industrial applications of pectic enzymes: a review Process Biochem 1998 33 21 28 10.1016/S0032-9592(97)00046-0 \nAmorim HV, Amorim VL (1977) Coffee enzymes and coffee quality.

Shiga toxin 1 (stx1), shiga toxin 2 (stx2), or a combination of both are responsible for most clinical symptoms of these diseases. Hence, various diagnostic methods have been developed so far to detect shiga toxins such as cell culture, ELISA, Rapid Latex Agglutination (RPLA) and hybridization, but due to high costs and labor time in addition to low sensitivity, they have not received much attention. The aim of this study was to develop a complete, rapid and reliable multiplex PCR (mPCR) method by using two pairs of specific primers to detect either the stx1 or the stx2 gene confirms the presence of E.coli O157:H7. The study results show that stx1F/stx1R primers are specific for stx1 and primers stx2F/stx2R are specific for stx2 genes in E. coli O157:H7. The mPCR method with two pairs of primers for amplifying the stx1, stx2 target genes to detect E. coli O157:H7 in food has been set up successfully. Complete method performed well in both types of food matrices with a detection limit of 3 CFU/25 g or mL of food samples. Tests on 180 food samples have shown a specificity value of 93.75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 82.83–100), a sensitivity of 100 % (95 % CI, 83.79–99.85 %), and an accuracy of 96.66 % (CI 95 %, 83.41–99.91 %). Interestingly, results indicate that the mPCR performed as well as the traditional culture methods and can reduce the diagnosis time to 2 days. Finally, complete mPCR method was applied to natural samples covering a wide variety of food types proving that the mPCR method was a rapid and reliable screening method for detection of E. coli O157:H7 in food and environmental samples.\n\nKeywords\nMultiplex PCRValidationE. coli O157:H7stx1 and stx2issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nThe best-known and also most notorious E. coli bacteria that produce Shiga toxin (STEC) is E. coli O157:H7 that caused foodborne diseases, usually hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (Karmali 1989, 2004). According to recent reports by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2014) there were 11 multistate outbreaks of STEC in the United States of America during 2011–2014 with six of them attributed to E. coli O157:H7. Furthermore, E. coli O157:H7 has been recognized as a major food safety concern due to its low infectious dose. It is highly virulent, an inoculation of fewer than 10–100 CFU of E. coli O157:H7 is sufficient to cause infection (Coffey et al. 2011). E. coli O157:H7 pathogens were usually linked with a wide variety of foods such as milk, meats, meat products, dairy products and fresh products, contaminated from the field with wildlife droppings (Bell 2002; Fedio et al. 2011; Mora et al. 2007; Pennington 2010). It is also reported that E. coli O157:H7 be cross-contaminated in the preparation of meat products from intestines (Wachtel et al. 2003).\n\nShiga toxin (Stx) is one of the major virulence factors involved in E. coli O157:H7 pathogenesis (Melton-Celsa et al. 2012); based on immunoreactivity, toxins are classified as either Stx1 or Stx2 (Strockbine et al. 1986), which damage intestinal epithelial cells and kidneys, causing HC and HUS, respectively (Johannes and Römer 2010). The stx gene in E. coli O157:H7 is associated with a prophage (Huang et al. 1987), and different subtypes of shiga toxin are identified as stx1, stx1c, stxfc, stx2, stx2e, stx2d and stx2g (Gobius et al. 2003). Stx2 producing strains appear to be more commonly responsible for serious complications such as HUS than those only Stx1 producing (Kleanthous et al. 1990; Read et al. 1992). Infections by STEC is a major health concern even developed countries as well as developing countries all over the world. Since shiga toxins cause many diseases, especially in children and immunocompromised elderly people, a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method with prognostic information would be rather useful. Isolation of E.coli O157:H7 from foods and fecal samples usually took few days with conventional diagnostic methods [ISO 16654 (2001)]. Conventional methods are laborious as they require the preparation of culture media, inoculation of plates and colony counting (Mandal et al. 2011). Furthermore, conventional methods may be limited by their low sensitivity (Lee et al. 2014). False-negative results may occur due to viable, but non-culturable pathogens. The failure to detect foodborne pathogens would increase the transmission risk of pathogens. So far, a variety of methodologies were developed to detect the presence of E. coli O157:H7; cell culture, serological, and Rapid Latex Agglutination (RPLA) have been utilized to detect shiga toxins or their respective genes. However, all these methods have their own shortcomings as they are time-consuming, quite costly and have limitations in handling many samples simultaneously. For cultivating samples in selective mediums, followed by latex agglutination or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for confirming their subtype (E. coli Pro O157). Unfortunately, the detection limit from indirect assay was at 105 cells/mL using antibodies, which was not enough to detect E. coli O157:H7 directly from food (Chart 1999). Rapid detection methods are important, particularly in food industry, as they are able to detect the presence of pathogens in raw and processed foods immediately. Rapid methods are also sensitive enough to detect pathogens that present in low numbers in the food. At present, molecular methods such as PCR are showing much promising results. In this situation, to overcome shortcomings of the aforementioned methods, mPCR is an appropriate alternative approach for detecting stx genes, improving both the sensitivity and specificity of the pathogen through amplification of its unique DNA. The mPCR is more convenient for rapid and reliable detection and quantification of pathogen-specific gene sequences.\n\nThe aim of the present work was the development of a complete multiplex PCR method for the detection of E.coli O157:H7 by using two pairs of specific primers to detect either the stx1 or the stx2 gene. Furthermore, the mPCR method is an appropriate alternative approach for detecting stx genes, able of achieving a low limit of detection, even in the presence of high numbers of competitors.\n\nMaterials and methods\nBacterial strains\nE. coli O157:H7 strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Three strains, one produces both Stx1 and Stx2, and one produces Stx1 only, one produces Stx2 only, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). In addition, these bacterial other pathogenic strains were approved by the National Agro-Forestry and Fisheries Quality Assurance Department Branch 4 (NAFIQAD 4); and eight E. coli strains (E1–E8) were isolated from retail beef, fork, vegetables and their geographical location was originated from Ho Chi Minh city area. The strains were verified by biochemical and immunologic methods. All isolates were stored at −80 °C in 10 % glycerol and grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) at 37 °C (Table 1).Table 1 Source and virulence gene profiles of E. coli O157:H7 strains and other strains used in this study\n\nNo.\tStrains\tPresence of\tSource\tIdentified\t\n1\t\nE. coli O157:H7\t\nStx1\n\tATCC\tNIHE\t\n2\t\nE. coli O157:H7\t\nStx2\n\tATCC\tHCMUS\t\n3\t\nE. coli O157:H7\t\nStx1, Stx2\n\tATCC\tNLU\t\n4\t\nShigella sonnei\n\t–\tATCC\tATCC 9290\t\n5\t\nSalmonella enterica\n\t–\tATCC\tATCC 14028\t\n6\t\nVibrio cholerae\n\t–\tATCC\tATCC 17802\t\n7\t\nE. coli\n\t–\tATCC\tATCC 11775\t\n8\t\nE. coli\n\t–\tATCC\tATCC 25922\t\n9\t\nE. coli (n = 8)\n\t–\tClinical isolate\tE1–E8\t\n\nATCC American type culture collection\n\n\n\nPrimer design\nTo design primers, central parts of shiga toxin genes were used as template.

All primers were synthesized by Sigma company.Table 2 Target genes and primer sequences used in this study\n\nTarget gene\tGenBank accession n\n\tPrimer\tPrimer sequence (5′ → 3′)\tPCR amplicon (bp)\t\n\nStx1\n\tAB083043.1\t\nstx1F\tgag cga aat aat tta tat gtg\t510\t\n\nstx1R\tttg atg atg gca att cag tat\t\n\nStx2\n\tJX161808.1\t\nstx2F\tcca tga caa cgg aca gca gtt\t780\t\n\nstx2R\tcct gtc aac tga gca ctt tgc\t\n\n\nSample collection\nA survey was carried out with samples from local suppliers. Samples were transported to the laboratory, either frozen or refrigerated, and were kept under the same conditions until analysis. A total of 500 samples were analyzed which included seafood, vegetables, and meats, of about 100 g each, were collected from the refrigerators of the butcher department that served the hospital and samples of cooked meat were collected from the hospital’s kitchen just after cooking. Besides, some of them were also collected from different at markets of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. All samples were transported to the laboratory at 4 °C and tested for E coli O157:H7 by both the traditional bacteriological method [ISO 16654 (2001)] and the multiplex PCR.\n\nTemplate DNA preparation after enrichment\nOne mL of overnight culture was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged 12,000×g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of 0.85 % NaCl. After another centrifugation at 12,000×g for 3 min, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of sterile water. After boiling at 100 °C for 10 min and being centrifuged at 12,000×g for 1 min, the supernatant was saved as a template DNA for PCR analysis.\n\nDirect culture method\nEscherichia coli O157 detection and identification was determined by the reference method described by International Organization for Standardization ISO 16654 (2001). Briefly, 25 g of each sample was diluted in 225 mL of Modified Tryptone Soya broth (mTSB—Oxoid, UK) added with Novobiocin, homogenized for 2 min at 260 rpm using a Stomacher (Model 400 circulator, Seward, Norfolk, England) and incubated for 18–24 h at 41.5 °C according to ISO 16654 (2001) method, as well as the remaining steps. After enrichment and immunomagnetic concentration steps, the selective and differential isolation of enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 was carried out on MacConkey Agar with Sorbitol, Cefixime, and Tellurite (CT-SMAC—Oxoid, UK) and incubated overnight at 42 °C. From each sample one well isolated suspected colony was transferred to tryptone soy agar (Oxoid) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, one isolate from the subculture was further tested for agglutination with an E. coli O157:H7 latex test kit (Becton–Dickinson, USA) for serogroup O157:H7 confirmation.\n\nIsolation and amplification of stx1 and stx2 genes by PCR\nPCR reagents in a final volume of 25 μL included: 1 μL template DNA, 0.5 μL Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/μL), 1 μL of each primer (10 pmol/μL), 1 μL dNTP mixture, 2.5 μL 10× PCR buffer, 1.5 μL MgCl2 (50 mM) and 16.5 μL sterile DDW. Thermal cycling of amplification mixture was performed in 30 cycles. The PCR program was carried out at 94 °C for 3 min followed denaturing for 45 s at 94 °C, annealing for 45 s at 54 °C and an extension for 1 min at 72 °C. The final extension was at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1 % agarose followed by staining with ethidium bromide (0.5 g/mL) then visualized under ultraviolet light, and the results were recorded by photography. For labeling of PCR products, the reaction of PCR was performed by dNTP mixture containing digoxigenin labeling mix (Digoxigenin dNTPs, Roche, Germany) with the same condition.\n\nValidation of multiplex PCR methods for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in food\n\nISO 16140 (2003) establishes the general principle and technical protocol for the validation of alternative methods in the microbiological analysis of food, animal feeding stuff, and environmental and veterinary samples. The validation protocol comprises two phases: the first is a method comparison study of the alternative method against the reference method [ISO 16654 (2001)], and the second is an interlaboratory study of each of the two methods. In the first step, \nISO 16140 (2003) validation examines the limit of detection (LOD50); The second step entails the organization of an interlaboratory study, as described in Annex H of ISO 16140 (2003), to determine the following parameters: such as sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, the false positive rate and false-negative rate, its compared with culture method, respectively. The data reported here describe the results of validation, according to \nISO 16140 (2003), of the reference method [ISO 16654 (2001)].\n\nDetermination of limit of detection (LOD50) following Spearman-Kaber method (Hitchins 2002; Kotz et al. 2006)\nTo calculate the LOD50 value, the process is performed as followed: (1) prepare 50 blank samples with the same matrix. To take 25 g for each sample (according to the validation method) into sterile plastic bag, then adds 225 mL modified Tryptone Soy Broth (mTSB); (2) a spiking inoculum was prepared starting from E. coli O157:H7 at a concentration of 10 CFU/mL: five binary series of dilutions (20, 2−1, 2−2, 2−3, 2−4 CFU/mL) were prepared and five different food samples were spiked with 1 mL of each dilution; (3) after incubation, the pre-enriched samples were tested with the multiplex PCR detection as described above; LOD50 is determined as below: logLOD50=L-d∑Pi-0,5=m;or LOD50=10m with confidence limit 95 %, LOD50 is in range {10m−2SQRT(Um); 10m+2SQRT(Um)} where LOD50 detection limit of the method, L log of lowest bacteria number that is spiked at this level where 100 % are positive results, d log of dilution concentration, Pi rate of positive results (50 % ≤ Pi ≤ 100 %) for the dilution concentration of i, Um estimation of measurement uncertainty for m, n number of repeatability test at the dilution concentration of i (n = 10).\n\nParameters evaluation of multiplex PCR method\nAccording to \nISO 16140 (2003), the parameters of the multiplex PCR method needed to evaluate such as relative accuracy (AC), relative sensitivity (SE) and relative specificity (SP), its compared with the reference method, respectively. A total of 60 test portions of third food categories were analyzed: 50 % of the samples were contaminated by E. coli O157:H7 at three levels (LOD, LOD × 10, LOD × 20); the other 50 % were negative samples. For the “vegetable-based products” category we evaluated 20 samples of lettuces, 18 of beans, 20 of spring onions, and 2 of watercress. For the “seafood product” category we analyzed 60 samples of seafood mix (previously tested negative for E. coli O157:H7) contaminated at the same concentrations as the “vegetable-based products” category. The relative detection level was determined after contamination of 60 meat products (chicken, pork and beef) with E. coli O157:H7 at three concentrations (20 negative controls, 20 samples spiked at LOD level, and 20 samples spiked at LOD × 3 level). Each combination (food product–level of contamination) was replicated six times with the alternative and reference methods for both food categories. Each combination (food product—level of contamination) was replicated six times with the alternative and reference methods for both food categories. For the “vegetable-based products” category we tested 60 samples while for “seafood products” category we analyzed 60 sample of seafood mix.\n\nThe inclusivity of the alternative method was evaluated by testing 50 pure cultures of target microorganism (E. coli O157:H7). The inoculums were 10–100 times greater than the minimum LOD50 of the alternative method. Exclusivity was verified by testing 30 pure cultures of non-target strains (50 % of E. coli, 50 % of other pathogenic strains consist of Shigella sonnei ATCC 9290, Salmonella enterica ATCC 14028 and Vibrio cholerae ATCC 17802). All samples of inclusivity and exclusivity were tested using only the alternative method. In adherence to the Annex H of \nISO 16140 (2003) guidelines and requirements for the organization, dispatching, and conducting the interlaboratory study, we selected the third most relevant food matrices [according to Annex B of \nISO 16140 (2003)] as the food matrix for the study: vegetable for “vegetables-based products”, seafood mix for “seafood products” and chicken, pork, beef for “meat products”. The samples were contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 and analyzed the blind samples with both the alternative and the reference method.\n\nResults\nSpecificity of the primers to detect stx1 and stx2 genes by PCR\nTo assess the specificity of the primers stx1F/stx1R and stx2F/stx2R for the detection of genes coding for toxins stx1 or stx2, the strains in Table 1 were used, which included 3 strains of E. coli O157:H7, 10 strains of non-E. coli O157:H7 and 3 other pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella enterica ATTC 14028, Shigella sonnei ATCC 9290 and Vibrio cholerae ATCC 17802).\n\nIn the primers stx1, the presence of amplified products size 520 bp after agarose gel electrophoresis. Reliable amplification of band of stx1 was obtained in standard E. coli 0157:H7 strains. As a negative control PCR was tested with other strains and water no amplicons were observed (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Specificity of primer pair stx1F/stx1R in the optimized PCR for amplification of E. coli O157:H7.

Reliable amplification of band of stx2 was obtained in standard E. coli 0157:H7 strains. As a negative control PCR was tested with other strains and water no amplicons were observed (Fig. 2).Fig. 2 Specificity of primer pair stx2F/stx2R in the optimized PCR for amplification of E. coli O157:H7.

Shiga toxin might be produced from strains carrying stx1 or stx2 gene only or both. Therefore, we have combined two primers for simultaneous detection of stx1 and stx2 in the same PCR amplification reaction. The reaction conditions for the multiplex PCR assay were optimized to ensure that all of the target gene sequences were satisfactorily amplified. The primers were designed with care to avoid areas of homology with other organisms. The primers had almost equal annealing temperature, which reduced the possibility of nonspecific amplification. The annealing temperature of 54 °C was finally selected based on nearly equal intensity of PCR products. Figure 3 shows the presence of amplified products size 520 and 780 bp after agarose gel electrophoresis. Reliable amplification of two bands of stx1 and stx2 was obtained in standard E. coli 0157:H7 strain (NLU). As a negative control multiplex PCR as water, other microbiologisms were tested no amplicons were observed.Fig. 3 Specificity of primer pair stx1, stx2 in the optimized PCR for amplification of E. coli O157:H7.

Blank samples used for validation are without E. coli O157:H7 contamination. These samples are considered negative control samples and used for spiking target bacteria for validation purposes. In this case, the strain of E. coli O157: H7 carrying stx1 and stx2 from Nong Lam University (NLU) was selected for contaminated to sample. The analysis as the multiplex PCR has been established, results show in Table 3. Appling to the formula above, the LOD of the multiplex PCR method was set at 3 CFU/25 g or mL for third food categories.Table 3 The results of LOD50 are summarized\n\nConcentration of E. coli O157 in 25 g (CFU)\tDilution factor\tNo. of test\tNo. of test with positive results\tRate of positive\t\n10\t\t10\t10\t1\t\n6\t\t10\t9\t0.9\t\n4\t2\t10\t7\t0.7\t\n3\t\t10\t5\t0.5\t\n2\t\t10\t3\t0.3\t\n\nCFU colony-forming unit\n\n\n\nThe results of validation of the technical parameters of newly mPCR methods\nThese parameters were determined for third groups of samples consist of vegetables-based products, seafood products and meat products.

In particular, only two product samples of each food category have resulted positive with the alternative method and negative with the reference method. For each level and each food/strain combination, the two methods were compared using Fisher’s exact test: a p value = 1 was obtained for third food categories.\n\nDiscussion\nE. coli O157:H7 is a worldwide threat to public health and the outbreaks historically have been associated with undercooked ground beef, meat and meat products, raw vegetables. E. coli O157:H7 strains possessing important virulence traits are required to be surveyed particularly when the strain is involved in disease outbreaks to assess the response strategies for containment. E. coli O157:H7 detection and identification was determined by the reference method described by International Organization for Standardization ISO 16654 (2001), which involves several steps of enrichment, plate isolation and biochemical identification, taking up to 4–6 days in the case of E. coli O157:H7. However, PCR-based techniques have the potential to allow for rapid and sensitive detection of foodborne pathogens. Since PCR can target unique genetic sequences such as virulence genes of microorganisms, it also has the advantage of potentially being an extremely specific assay (Fratamico and Strobaugh 1998). In addition, many authors have demonstrated the advantages of using multiplex PCR methods (Elizaquivel and Aznar 2008; Ruiz-Rueda et al. 2011; Singh et al. 2011). In this study, we developed a rapid, reliable and specific mPCR method to successfully detect E. coli O157:H7 in food by analyzing the two major virulence genes. The primers used in the present study were designed to specifically amplify Stx1, Stx2 gene of E. coli O157:H7, respectively. Additional, specificity of the primers to detect stx1 and stx2 genes as well examined on strains non-E. coli O157:H7, to achieving as expected. Meanwhile, the process of multiplex PCR involves designing each primer set in a single PCR mixture to amplify amplicons that are specific to the target DNA sequences. Furthermore, the annealing temperature of the multiplex PCR reaction is optimized to achieve distinct bands for each primer sets. For the mPCR reported here, all the primers were designed with the view to have a common annealing temperature to get preferable amplification at a single temperature and care was also taken to maintain at least 100 bps differences between product sizes for good resolution during agarose gel electrophoresis. Our study portrayed the best amplicons at high annealing temperature of 54 °C (Fig. 3).\n\nBacterial pathogens may coexist, at different concentrations, in the same food sample, but they usually occur at low levels. Their detection is usually preceded by an enrichment step to increase cell numbers to the detection level. Hence, enrichment is necessary to obtain a higher number of positive results by mPCR with E. coli O157:H7. The adequacy of mPCR in identifying E. coli 0157:H7 strains in general and the toxin containing strains in particular following overnight enrichment of food and environmental samples in mTSB broth was well established. The stx1 and stx2 genes being responsible for the expression of the potential toxin molecules can be easily be identified by the reported mPCR and this protocol would help in detecting them during biological emergencies. Considering the low cost and the associated rapidity to detect the four genes simultaneously, it is believed that this may serve as a powerful tool for not only to obtain a reliable identification of E. coli 0157:H7, but also in assessing the toxin potential of the strain as well. The procedure is especially suited to fit into the daily work requirement of routine food quality control laboratories since detection and identification of the toxin genes of the pathogen from diverse food sources is becoming an important component of the diagnostic inventory of such laboratories. Given the long turnaround time associated with traditional culture methods, PCR in any case is a rapid and reliable screen for the detection of E. coli 0157:H7 harboring stx1 and stx2 genes. These species are long-term and highly sensitive at different culture conditions: using DNA as the target for sample screening overcomes problems with culture conditions, allowing the rapid identification of positive samples, with the identification of a possible E. coli O157:H7 source within 48 h. By contrast, the reference method [ISO 16654 (2001)] requires at least 4 days for determining negative samples and more than 7 days for species identification. Also, the laboratory in Vietnam analysis of E. coli O157:H7 in foods mainly based on the conventional culture method. Therefore, the analysis time is 4–7 days, and not conformity with the requirements for fast analysis of food samples suspected E. coli O157:H7 serve the purpose of monitoring emergency.\n\nThe results of this study show that mPCR is useful to detect and identify E. coli O157:H7 in food, even if the concentration of bacteria is low (2–3 cells of bacteria/25 g of food). Incubation of the homogenized food in mTSB at 41.5 or 37 °C for at least 10 h is necessary to archive the levels of enrichment for reliable detection of this pathogen in food. The study also shows that the mPCR system has comparable sensitivity to the direct culture method and would be amenable for on-site analysis of food by marginally skilled personnel, since it does not require the same level of training to perform as does the more rigorous multiplexed PCR technique described described here although there is evident that both used methods characterize distinct specificity and that they are not completely replaceable.\n\nIn conclusion, the multiplex PCR method with two pairs of primers for amplifying the stx1, stx2 target genes to detect E. coli O157:H7 in food has been set up successfully. The novel method is developed with the following basic parameters: enrichment of 25 g samples into sterile bags already containing 225 mL mTSB, incubate at 41.5 °C for 10–24 h. One milliliter enrichment solution was taken at the end of incubation period and processed for DNA extraction by boiling method. The DNA was used as template in multiplex PCR assay with primers stx1F/stx1R and stx2F/stx2R, at concentration 0.5 μM of each primer. The final concentration of MgCl2 is 2.5 μM. The results of evaluating of method show that the multiplex PCR method has LOD is 3 CFU/25 g or mL sample, sensitivity is 100 %, accuracy is 96.66 %, specificity is 93.75 %. A newly developed multiplex PCR assay for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 based on shiga-like toxin genes stx1 and stx2, have indicated all the criteria and parameters tested were met according to laboratory requirements. Our data suggest that this commercial kit is suitable for use in official controls on vegetable, seafood and dairy product food samples. Moreover, because multiplex PCR-based methods are fast and easier for laboratory testing, they can identify the likely microbiological source in 48 h. The rapid response time could help public health authorities in diagnosing and treating foodborne illnesses early caused by E. coli O157:H7. Finally, this approach could provide timely data for updating report database systems with information about risk factors.\n\nThis work was supported by the Vietnam Education Foundation for funding (VEF Fellowship to V.

The organism had a free cyanide degradation efficiency of 80 and 32 % from an initial concentration of 250 and 450 mg CN−/L, respectively. Additionally, the organism was able to degrade thiocyanate, achieving a degradation efficiency of 78 and 98 % from non- and free cyanide spiked cultures, respectively. The organism was capable of heterotrophic nitrification but was unable to denitrify aerobically. The organism was unable to degrade free cyanide in the absence of a carbon source, but it was able to degrade thiocyanate heterotrophically, achieving a degradation efficiency of 79 % from an initial concentration of 250 mg SCN−/L. Further increases in thiocyanate degradation efficiency were only observed when the cultures were spiked with free cyanide (50 mg CN−/L), achieving a degradation efficiency of 98 % from an initial concentration of 250 mg SCN−/L. This is the first study to report free cyanide and thiocyanate degradation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The higher free cyanide and thiocyanate tolerance of the isolate STK 03, which surpasses the stipulated tolerance threshold of 200 mg CN−/L for most organisms, could be valuable in microbial consortia for the degradation of cyanides in an industrial setting.\n\nKeywords\nBiodegradationCyanideHeterotrophic nitrificationPseudomonas aeruginosa STK 03Thiocyanatehttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001321National Research Foundation (ZA)issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nNatural and anthropogenic activities contribute to cyanide and thiocyanate (SCN−) contamination in the environment. However, a significant source of cyanide contamination is through anthropogenic activities such as the cyanidation process, which is used in the mining industry to extract precious metals such as gold and silver from refractory sulphidic ores (Gould et al. 2012). Since free cyanide (CN−) is a highly reactive chemical, it also reacts with a number of metals that are present within the ore forming metal-complexed cyanides which are categorised as: weak acid dissociable and strong acid dissociable cyanides (Mudder et al. 2001). Additionally, cyanide reacts with sulphur species present within the ore, thus forming significant concentrations of thiocyanate which can be up to 3000 mg SCN−/L (Stott et al. 2001; van Hille et al. 2015; van Zyl et al. 2015). These compounds contribute significantly to environmental deterioration as many living organisms are susceptible to cyanide compounds. The presence of these compounds has been associated with wildlife mortalities (Donato et al. 2007) and wastewater treatment plant failures as a result of the CN/SCN susceptibility of the organisms which are normally employed in such systems (Kim et al. 2008a, b; Han et al. 2014). Cyanide is mostly removed in industrial effluents by, amongst others, alkaline chlorination or hydrogen peroxide or ozonation. However, these methods have proven to be environmentally deteriorative as they produce end-products which are hazardous to the environment (Botz et al. 2005; Mudder and Botz 2004). More attention has been shifted to the biotechnological approach for the degradation of cyanide and thiocyanate as it is cost effective, environmentally benign and does not produce end-products which are hazardous to the environment (Akcil and Mudder 2003; Akcil 2003; Patil and Paknikar 1999). The existence of CN/SCN resistant, tolerant and degrading bacterial and fungal organisms has contributed significantly to the development of an effective degradation process, through understanding the microbiological contributions of individual organisms such that accurate predictive models can be developed (Stott et al. 2001). Individually, each specie in a consortia possess specific enzymes and is able to use either hydrolytic, substitution/transfer, reductive and oxidative pathways for the degradation of cyanides (Ebbs 2004).\n\nA number of studies have been reported on bacterial decomposition of cyanide and thiocyanate, and organisms such as Bacillus pumilus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Burkholderia cepacia, Rhodococcus ssp, Thiobacillus ssp, Halomonas ssp and many other organisms have the potential to degrade cyanide and thiocyanate (Adjei and Ohta 2000; Kao et al. 2003; Meyers et al. 1991; Stott et al. 2001; Maniyam et al. 2011). Organisms belonging to the Pseudomonadaceae family have also been reported to degrade cyanide, thiocyanate and metal-complexed cyanides. Organisms such as Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Pseudomonas flourescens have been observed as cyanide and thiocyanate degraders (Grigor’eva et al. 2006, 2008, 2009; Karavaiko et al. 2000, Luque-Almagro et al. 2005). However, free cyanide and thiocyanate degradation by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain has never been reported. Additionally, the effect of free cyanide on thiocyanate biodegradation by P. aeruginosa has never been reported. Hence, the primary aim of this study was to investigate free cyanide and thiocyanate biodegradation ability of an isolate, Pseudomonas aeruginosa STK 03.\n\nMaterials and methods\nMicroorganism and inoculum preparation\nA bacterium that was able to grow on free cyanide and thiocyanate containing media was isolated from a site in Nigeria contaminated with cyano group containing compounds including poly aromatic hydrocarbons. The isolate was denoted as STK 03. The organism was isolated using a culture-based technique. A serial dilution on sterile saline solution was performed on the original sample and plated on nutrient agar plates containing 100 mg CN−/L at 30 °C for 48 h. This was done to selectively isolate cyanide-tolerant organisms. Identification of the organism was performed using the 16S rDNA sequencing followed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using bacterial universal primers. The DNA was extracted using a ZR Fungal/Bacterial DNA Kit (Zymo Research, California, USA). The presence of the genomic DNA was assessed using a 1 % (w/v) molecular grade agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide (EtBr), using 1X Tris–acetate–ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (TAE) electrophoresis buffer at 100 V for 1 h. PCR was performed using a GeneAmp PCR 9700 System (Applied Biosystems, USA). Amplification of the target DNA by PCR was performed in a total reaction volume of 10 μL containing 0.5 μL (±50 ng/μL) of the purified genomic DNA, 50 mM of the forward and reverse primers and 5 μL of a 2X KapaTaq Readymix solution (KapaBiosystems, South Africa). Bacterial-specific primers used were the forward 8F primer 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′ and reverse primer 1492R 5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′. The amplification process included an initial denaturing step at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 36 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min. The reaction was completed with a final extension period of 7 min at 72 °C followed by cooling and storage at 4 °C. PCR amplicons (10 µL) were electrophoretically analysed on a 1 % (w/v) molecular grade agarose gel that was stained with ethidium bromide, using 1× TAE electrophoresis buffer at 100 V for 1 h, to determine whether the amplification was successful. The PCR amplicons were run on an ABI 3010xl Genetic analyser. The sequences were blasted against the NCBI GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the sequences were deposited on the NCBI gene bank database. The isolate was allocated an accession number, KR011154.\n\nFor both free cyanide and thiocyanate degradation studies, the organism was grown for a period of 48 h in minimal media (MM) that contained (g/L): K2HPO4 (4.3), KH2PO4 (3.4), MgCl·6H2O (0.4) and whey waste (1.4). The pH of the media was adjusted to an initial pH of 10 for free cyanide studies and 8.5 for thiocyanate studies, with pH not being controlled thereafter. The organism was unable to degrade thiocyanate above a pH of 8.5 (data not shown); hence, the pH was set at 8.5 for SCN− degradation studies. The media did not contain any nitrogen source and a mature culture was used as an inoculum, representing 10 % (v/v) of the total volume used for the biodegradation studies.\n\nExperimental plan\nThe organism was inoculated in MM which was supplemented with free cyanide (as KCN) at concentrations of 250 and 450 mg CN−/L, and thiocyanate (as KSCN) at 250 mg SCN−/L, in a total working volume of 200 mL. The uninoculated bioreactors served as controls. The bioreactors were incubated in an orbital shaker at 180 rpm and 30 °C. Cyanide and thiocyanate studies were run separately. Free cyanide studies were ran in airtight shake flasks fitted with sampling ports while thiocyanate studies were ran in Erlenmeyer flasks. The use of airtight flasks was done to minimise cyanide volatilisation. To demonstrate nitrification and aerobic denitrification, the isolate was inoculated onto 200 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with MM medium, containing an initial concentration of ammonium (as NH4Cl) and nitrate (as NaNO3) of 300 mg NH4+/L and 100 mg NO3−-N/L, respectively. The initial pH was set at a pH of 10 for both the nitrification and denitrification studies. Aliquots (2 mL) were periodically withdrawn from the flasks and analysed for free cyanide, thiocyanate, ammonium, nitrates and sulphates as described in “Analytical methods ”.\n\nBiological cyanide removal efficiency\nA mass balance equation for the determination of the biologically degraded cyanide, taking into account cyanide volatilisation, is shown in Eqs. 1 and 2. 1 CNS--(CNR-+CNV-)=CNB- where 2 CNV-=(CNVo--CNVf-) \n\nBiological removal efficiency (BRE) was determined according to Eq. 3 3 BRE(%)=CNB-CNS-×100 where CNB- is the biologically degraded cyanide (mg CN−/L), CNS- is the initial free cyanide concentration in the media (mg CN−/L), CNR- is the residual free cyanide measured in the inoculated media (mg CN−/L), CNV- is the cyanide that volatilised during culture incubation (mg CN−/L), CNVo- is the initial cyanide concentration in the control cultures (mg CN−/L), and CNVf- is the final cyanide concentration in the control cultures (mg CN−/L).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe experimental error was calculated as the standard error of mean using the standard deviation obtained from the multiple sets of data (n = 2), as demonstrated in Eq. 4: 4 SEM =Standard deviationnumber of samples tested \n\nAnalytical methods\nMerck ammonium (NH4+) (00683), cyanide (CN−) (09701), nitrate (14773) and sulphate (00617) test kits were used to quantify the concentration of free cyanide, ammonium, and nitrates using a Merck Spectroquant Nova 60 instrument. Briefly, the cyanide test kit works on the reaction of cyanide with chloramine-T and pyridine-barbituric acid. The ammonium test kit works on the Berthelot reaction between ammonium ions, chlorine and phenolic compounds to form indophenol dyes. The nitrate test kit makes use of concentrated sulphuric acid in the presence of a benzoic acid derivative while the sulphate test kit makes use of the reaction between sulphates and barium ions and the sulphates are measured turbidimetrically. Nitrites were determined according to the method of Rider and Mellon (1946). The pH was measured using a Crison Basic20 pH meter which was calibrated daily. The microbial population was quantified using a Jenway 6715 UV/visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm. Thiocyanate was quantified using the ferric method (Hovinen et al. 1999).\n\nResults and discussion\nIn this study, a free cyanide and thiocyanate tolerant bacterium was isolated and identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa STK 03. Free cyanide biodegradation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa STK 03 and growth patterns in MM is shown in Fig. 1a, b, respectively. The organism was able to degrade 250 and 450 mg CN−/L, achieving a BRE of 80 and 32 % within 150 h, respectively. Recently, it has been reported that an active aerobic degradation process has a maximum cyanide threshold concentration of 200 mg CN−/L (Kuyucak and Akcil 2013). However, in this study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa STK 03 was able to degrade free cyanide in cultures containing cyanide concentrations above 200 mg CN−/L. Free cyanide degradation was accompanied by growth of the organism, with the initial cyanide having a negative impact on the growth of the organism. The cultures that had low cyanide concentrations showed a shorter lag phase while the cultures with a higher concentration demonstrated a prolonged lag phase. This phenomenon was observed elsewhere (Mekuto et al. 2013), where a Bacillus consortia showed varying lag phases with respect to different initial cyanide concentrations, with cultures with the higher concentrations showing a prolonged lag phase. The prolonged lag phase with an increase in free cyanide concentration was a result of cyanide inhibition on microbial growth.Fig. 1 Free cyanide degradation profile at different concentrations and growth profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa STK 03 (a) and growth patterns of the organism (b). Error bars represent deviations\n\n\n\nThe degradation of free cyanide resulted in the accumulation of ammonium in the medium, which suggested a possible hydrolytic mechanism of cyanide degradation (Ebbs 2004; Akcil et al. 2003). The maximum ammonium nitrogen concentration from the cultures that had an initial cyanide concentration of 250 and 450 mg CN−/L was 86 and 61 mg NH4+-N/L, respectively. Subsequently, the nitrate nitrogen concentration accumulated in the media, with an observed maximum nitrate nitrogen concentration of 31.2 and 62.4 mg NO3−-N/L being observed, respectively (see Fig. 2). The ammonium nitrogen concentration decreased after 64 and 41 h from both cultures, with the residual ammonium nitrogen concentration being 42 and 4.5 mg NH4+-N/L from the cultures that contained an initial cyanide concentration of 250 and 450 mg CN−/L, respectively. This showed heterotrophic nitrification capability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa STK 03. However, the organism was unable to remove nitrates, thus demonstrating the incapability of the organism to carry out aerobic denitrification. However, Pseudomonas stutzeri C3 was found to be able to carry out aerobic denitrification but was unable to carry out heterotrophic nitrification (Ji et al. 2015), while in a separate study Pseudomonas stutzeri YZN-001 was able to carry out nitrification and aerobic denitrification (Zhang et al. 2011); a suggestion that isolate STK 03 does not possess denitrification characteristics that are responsible for total nitrogen removal in cyanide-contaminated effluent. To prove heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification, both ammonium (as NH4Cl) and nitrate (as NaNO3) were used as nitrogen sources, in separate studies. STK 03 was able to carry out nitrification (see Fig. 3), achieving a nitrification rate of 1.56 mg NH4+-N L−1 h−1 with subsequent production and accumulation of nitrates and nitrites while ammonium stripping was determined to amount to 15 %. Both nitrates and nitrites increased during the nitrification stage; however, the concentration of nitrites decreased to 1.75 mg NO2−-N/L after 150 h, with the accumulation of nitrates being observed (Table 1).Fig. 2 Ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen profiles as a function of time. Error bars represent deviations\n\nFig. 3 Heterotrophic nitrification profile as a function of time.

In the presence of a carbon source, there was a logarithmic increase of ammonium nitrogen from 0 to 40 h and, thereafter, the ammonium concentration reached a plateau. The detection of ammonium nitrogen in the media was due to cell death or disruption and subsequent release of ammonium-related compounds due to cyanide toxicity. This meant that STK 03 was unable to use cyanide as a carbon and nitrogen source and, therefore, an external carbon source was necessary to meet the carbon source requirements of the organism.Fig. 4 Autotrophic degradation of free cyanide and ammonium nitrogen formation profile. Error bars represent deviations\n\n\n\nThe capability of the isolate to degrade thiocyanate was evaluated in batch cultures and the organism was able to degrade 250 mg SCN−/L to 55.5 mg SCN−/L over a period of 200 h (Fig. 5). This is equivalent to a degradation efficiency of 78 %. Thiocyanate degradation resulted in the accumulation of sulphate sulphur, with the maximum residual concentration of 90 mg SO42−-S/L being observed. The maximum ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were 120 mg NH4+-N/L and 90 mg NO3−-N/L, respectively, with observed nitrification after 120 h resulting in residual ammonium concentration of 53 mg NH4+-N/L after 200 h. Denitrification of the nitrates was not observed, thus demonstrating incapacity of STK 03 to denitrify.Fig. 5 Thiocyanate degradation profile and formation of degradation products without the presence of free cyanide. Error bars represent deviations\n\n\n\nThiocyanate degradation under the influence of free cyanide spiking was also evaluated (Fig. 6). Cyanide spiking was carried out at 25 and 100 h. Under these conditions, STK 03 had a degradation efficiency increase to 98 % from an initial concentration of 250 mg SCN−/L, meaning that the presence of free cyanide propagated thiocyanate degradation. It was hypothesised that this observation might be due to a metabolic shock response that might have triggered or upregulated the expression of thiocyanate degrading enzymes. The residual thiocyanate concentration was found to be 4.7 mg SCN−/L. Sulphates and nitrates accumulated throughout the experiments reached a maximum sulphate and nitrate concentration of 144.5 mg SO42−-S/L and 55 mg NO3−-N/L. Thiocyanate degradation was accompanied by ammonium generation, resulting in a maximum ammonium concentration of 123 mg NH4+-N/L. Ammonium oxidation from 120 h was observed with a sudden increase in nitrates thereafter, although denitrification was not observed.Fig. 6 Thiocyanate degradation profile and formation of degradation products with the presence of free cyanide. Error bars represent deviations. The arrows represent cyanide spiking intervals\n\n\n\nPseudomonas stutzeri 18 and putida 21 were able to degrade SCN− from an initial concentration of 60 mg SCN−/L with the terminal sulphur products from SCN− degradation being thiosulfate and tetrathionate, respectively (Grigor’eva et al. 2006). In this study, the terminal sulphur product from SCN− degradation was sulphates. This suggested that these organisms employ a different biochemical pathway for the degradation of SCN−.\n\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrated the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa STK 03, which was originally isolated from an oil spill site contaminated with compounds containing cyano groups, and was able to degrade free cyanide and thiocyanate under alkaline conditions, achieving a BRE of 80 and 32 % from 250 and 450 mg CN−/L, respectively. Additionally, the SCN− degradation efficiency was 78 and 98 % from non- and cyanide-spiked cultures, respectively. This was a first study on thiocyanate degradation under alkaline conditions by an organism belonging to the Pseudomonadaceae family. Additionally, STK 03 surpassed the stipulated free cyanide tolerance threshold of 200 mg CN−/L, making this organism valuable for application in large-scale wastewater treatment applications, particularly for wastewater containing free cyanide and thiocyanate. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the presence of free cyanide accelerated thiocyanate degradation rates using the isolate under observation. This information is valuable in constituting microbial consortia for the degradation of cyanide containing wastewater. It is, however, recommended that: (1) simultaneous biodegradation of free cyanide, metal-complexed cyanide and thiocyanate in the same media be evaluated, (2) genes and enzymes involved in the biodegradation of free cyanide, ammonium oxidation and thiocyanate be investigated, (3) the degradation of cyanide and related compounds in continuous biofilm systems by the organism need to be evaluated, and (4) the mechanistic changes on thiocyanate degradation in the presence of free cyanide be further investigated at a genetic level.\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the funding from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), University Research Fund (URF RK 16) and National Research Foundation (NRF).\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest associated with this work.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAdjei MD  Ohta Y   Factors affecting the biodegradation of cyanide by Burkholderia cepacia  strain C-3 J Biosci Bioeng 2000 89 274 277 10.1016/S1389-1723(00)88833-7 16232743 \nAkcil A   Destruction of cyanide in gold mill effluents: biological versus chemical treatments Biotechnol Adv 2003 21 501 511 10.1016/S0734-9750(03)00099-5 14499151 \nAkcil A  Mudder T   Microbial destruction of cyanide wastes in gold mining: process review Biotechnol Lett 2003 25 445 450 10.1023/A:1022608213814 12882268 \nAkcil A  Karahan AG  Ciftci H  Sagdic O   Biological treatment of cyanide by natural isolated bacteria (Pseudomonas sp .)

From a total of 24 bacteria, 4 actinomycetes and 8 fungi isolated from diverse marine sources, five bacterial species-BLM3, BSP2, BCS1, BCS4 and BMA6 showed inhibitory activity against at least one of the tested pathogens viz., Klebsiella pneumonia KU1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa VL3, Salmonella enterica typhimurium MTCC 98, Escherichia coli MTCC 40, Micrococcus luteus MTCC 105, Staphylococcus simulans MTCC 3610, Proteus vulgaris MTCC 426, Vibrio fluvialis, Vibrio sp. P3a and Vibrio sp. P3b. The isolated actinomycetes and fungi did not produce significant inhibition zones against the tested pathogens; however, the macroalgal isolated actinomycetes strain AMA1 produced reddish pigment in Starch Casein medium which remained stable till the stationary phase of growth. The marine sediment isolate BCS4, identified as Bacillus sp. showed wide spectrum of activity against the tested Gram positive bacteria, S. simulans MTCC 3610 and Gram negative bacteria, Proteus vulgaris with zone of inhibitions of 25 and 11 mm respectively. Better extraction of the bioactive compound was obtained with ethyl acetate when compared with methanol, benzene and hexane and TLC analysis revealed the presence of an active compound. The 16SrRNA sequencing confirmed the potent strain belong to Bacillus sp. and hence designated Bacillus sp. BCS4.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-015-0318-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nMicrobial diversityMarine microbesBioactivityBacillus sp.

The marine ecosystem being less explored, have prospects for finding novel bioactive producing microbes. Marine microbes represent a distinctive group of organism owing to their immense genetic (Strobel and Daisy 2003) and biochemical diversity (Rusch et al. 2007) and are rich sources of a large variety of bioactive compounds (Debbab et al. 2010). These originate mainly in sediments but they are also present in open oceans in association with other marine organisms (Supriya and Yogesh 2010). Marine invertebrates and plants, in particular, represent an environment rich in microorganisms that produce compounds with bioactive properties including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, antifouling and antibiofilm activities (Glöckner et al. 2012). The microbial symbionts were been crucial in the discovery of many bioactive compounds reported earlier. The competition among microbes for space and nutrients is one of the driving forces behind the production of precious antibiotics and other useful pharmaceuticals in the marine environment (Thakur et al. 2005b). Microorganisms associated with marine invertebrates are proved to be valuable candidates for drug discovery (Jensen and Fenical 2000; Hentschel et al. 2003; Imada 2004; Thakur et al. 2005a).\n\nThe marine microbes include cellular life forms such as bacteria, fungi and plankton, along with viruses that free load along with them. The marine bacteria represent one of the hardly untapped sources of potent therapeutic and novel drug leads. The emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria poses a major threat which in turn forces the discovery of new potent drugs to replace the conventional antibiotics. The decline in the discovery of newer antibiotics of the terrestrial origin necessitates exploring new ecological niches most notably the marine. Marine bacteria showing antibacterial activities have been isolated from various biotypes and most frequently isolated strains belong to the genus Bacillus, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, Flavobacterium, and Alteromonas (Jayanth et al. 2001; Nithya et al. 2011; Eltmany et al. 2014; Marinho et al. 2009; Baranova and Eqorov 1989; Leon et al. 2010). However, a major constraint in the discovery of novel drugs from the marine microbes rely up on the fact that majority of the marine microbes are uncultivable in the laboratory conditions. Nevertheless, using cultivated microorganisms is still the only way to get detailed information about microbial characteristics and processes, thus highlighting the need to further focus on culturing microorganisms and developing better culturing techniques (Glöckner et al. 2012).\n\nMarine microbes are rich and yet less harnessed source of structurally diverse secondary metabolites, many of which possess unique biological activities. The present study attempts to isolate and screen novel bioactive producing microbes from the Vizhinjam and Mullor area of the South-west coast of India, which are known for their rich biodiversity and novel compounds in them.\n\nMaterials and methods\nCollection of samples\nThe marine samples for the isolation of microorganisms were collected from the Vizhinjam and Mulloor coast of Kerala, India. The geographical position of Vizhinjam coast is Longitude E 76°59′ and Latitude N 8°22′.\n\nThe samples collected include the Sepia and Crab from the fish landing centre in Vizhinjam coast and Limpets, macroalgae and the sediments from the Mulloor coast. The samples except marine sediments soon after collection were washed with sterile distilled water to remove the soil and brought to the laboratory in sterile polythene bags.\n\nIsolation of associated microbes from the marine samples\nThe samples viz., crab, sepia and limpets after removing their outer shell and intestine and the macroalgae were crushed. The resultant was serially diluted in normal saline (0.85 % NaCl) and 0.1 ml spread plated in Zobell Marine Agar (Hi-Media), glucose agar and starch-casein agar to determine the growth of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes respectively. Similarly, the coastal sediments were serially diluted and plated. The plates were monitored for 48 h by incubating at 37 °C for distinct bacterial colonies. The plated glucose agar was incubated at 27 ± 2 °C for 48 h and starch-casein agar at 27 ± 2 °C for 5–7 days to examine the growth of marine fungi and actinomycetes respectively. In all the cases, CFU/ml was recorded and the morphologically distinct colonies of the bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes were streak plated in respective agar plates to get the auxenic microbial isolate. The pure cultures of the isolates were stored in glycerol stocks at refrigeration temperatures for further studies.\n\nScreening of antibacterial activity of the isolated marine microbes\nThe indicator strains used to determine the antibacterial activity of the isolated marine bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes included both the human pathogenic and fish pathogenic bacteria and are listed in Table 1. The bacterial cultures were stored in agar slants at refrigeration temperatures and were activated in fresh nutrient agar medium as and when required.Table 1 Indicator bacterial strains used for screening the antibacterial activity of isolated Marine microorganisms\n\nSl. no.\tBacterial strains\tSource\t\n1\t\nKlebsiella pneumoniae KU1\tClinical isolate\t\n2\t\nPseudomonas aeruginosa VL3\tClinical isolate\t\n3\t\nSalmonella enterica typhimurium MTCC 98\tMTCCa\n\t\n4\t\nEscherichia coli MTCC 40\tMTCC\t\n5\t\nMicrococcus luteus MTCC 105\tMTCC\t\n6\t\nStaphylococcus simulans MTCC 3610\tMTCC\t\n7\t\nProteus vulgaris MTCC 426\tMTCC\t\n8\t\nVibrio fluvalis\n\tFish pathogen\t\n9\t\nVibrio sp.

After the respective incubation period, 1 ml of sample was withdrawn from the culture flask and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant so obtained was filtered using 0.22 µm microfilter (Hi-Media). The resultant cell free supernatant was examined for antibacterial activity against the indicator bacterial strains. For determining the antibacterial activity of the fungal isolates and actinomycetes, the strains were inoculated in glucose broth and starch-casein broth and incubated for 5 and 7 days respectively under shaking conditions. The indicator strains were activated in Nutrient Broth (Hi-Media) by incubating the inoculated broth for 24 h at 37 °C. The antibacterial activity was detected using the well-diffusion method (BSI 1968). The bacterial culture was swabbed on to Mueller–Hinton agar (Hi-Media) plates. Using a cork borer, wells of 7 mm diameter was made on the agar plates containing the lawn of indicator bacterial strain. The cell free supernatant (50 µl) of the marine microbes was added to each well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The plates were observed for the zones of inhibition around the well and the zone diameter (mm) was recorded.\n\nDetermination of growth characteristics of the potent bacterial isolate\nAmong the microbes screened for bioactive production, active marine bacterial isolate BCS4 was subjected to determination of growth characteristics for effective extraction of the bioactive compound. The bacterial isolate BCS4 was inoculated in 100 ml Zobell Marine Broth and growth and bioactivity was determined every 24 h interval for 120 h. The determination of growth was carried out by taking the optical density of the inoculated culture broth at 600 nm after every 24 h. The bioactivity was determined by assaying the cell-free supernatant against the indicator strains selected by well-diffusion method as described earlier.\n\nExtraction and chemical screening of bioactive compound from the potent isolate\nThe potent isolate was inoculated into 100 ml of Zobell Marine Broth and incubated at 37 °C for 96 h. The culture was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant filtered. The resultant filtrate was extracted separately with solvents viz., methanol, ethyl acetate, benzene and hexane @ 1 ml/ml culture supernatant of the marine isolate and dried at room temperature (28 ± 2 °C); in order to determine the best solvent extraction strategy for this bioactive compound. The well-diffusion assay method was used to determine the bioactivity of the extracted compounds. The solvent which extracted the compound better was used for the further extraction of the bioactive compound.\n\nThin layer chromatography (TLC) technique was employed to screen the bioactive compound. The crude ethyl acetate extract obtained from Bacillus sp. BCS4 was partially purified by TLC using silica gel coated chromatography plates. In order to determine the best solvent system for effective separation of crude compound, solvents such as ethyl acetate, methanol, chloroform and water were used in the proportions viz., (1) Ethyl acetate:Methanol:Water (20:2.7:2; v/v/v), (2) Ethyl acetate:Methanol:Water (20:2.8:1; v/v/v) and (3) Chloroform:Methanol (9:1; v/v). An aliquot of crude extract was spotted onto the silica gel plate and allowed to dry for a few minutes. Afterwards, the plate was developed with the solvent as mobile phase in the earlier mentioned proportion in a previously saturated glass chamber with eluting solvents for 30 min at room temperature. The developed plate was dried under normal air and the spots were visualized under visible light. Retention factor (Rf) value of the spot separated on the TLC Plate was determined by adopting the formula, Rf value=Movement of solute from the originMovement of the solvent from the origin The TLC plates were observed for distinct bands. The compound was eluted from the developed plate by scrapping off silica gel and mixed well with ethyl acetate and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was subjected to determination of bioactivity using well-diffusion assay against the indicator strain S. simulans MTCC3610 and observed for inhibition zone after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h.\n\nMolecular characterization of the strain BCS4\nThe molecular characterization of the active marine bacterial isolate which showed maximum inhibitory activity against the indicator strains tested were subjected to biochemical and molecular characterization studies based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. The total genomic DNA extraction of the active bacteria cultured in Zobell Marine Broth was carried out by Phenol/chloroform extraction method. The 16S rRNA gene of the isolate was amplified using Universal Eubacterial 16S rRNA gene primers and sequenced. The resultant 16S rRNA gene sequence from the potent isolate BCS4 was compared with other bacterial sequences from the GenBank nucleotide database with BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990) to analyse pairwise homology and phylogenetically analyzed using MEGA 6.01 software.\n\nResults\nIsolation of microorganisms from the marine invertebrates, macroalgae and coastal sediments\nThe samples from the marine environment (Vizhinjam and Mulloor Coast) used for the isolation of marine bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes include the coastal sediments, marine invertebrates viz., crab, sepia and limpet and the marine macroalgae. The isolated microorganisms from the respective agar plates after spread plating and incubation for 24 h were streaked to get pure cultures of the same. The bacteria were grown in Zobell Marine Agar medium; the list and source of the isolated bacterial strains are presented in Table 1. The total count of bacteria per ml of the sample viz., coastal sediments, crab, sepia, limpets and the marine macroalgae was 6.5 × 106, 3.2 × 105, 5.9 × 105, 1.9 × 105 and 2.8 × 104 CFU respectively (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Marine microbes associated with samples collected off south-west Coast of India\n\n\n\nThe actinomycetes isolated from different samples in starch-casein agar plates after spread plating and incubation for 7 days were streaked onto fresh starch-casein agar plates for getting pure culture of the same. The isolated actinomycetes from different marine sources are given in Table 2. The macroalgal isolate AMA2 produced a pigmented colony upon incubation which yielded a red coloured pigmentation in the starch casein agar plate as well in the culture broth up on 7 days incubation. The total count of actinomycetes per ml of the sample viz., coastal sediments, crab, sepia, limpets and the marine macroalgae was 5.5 × 102, 0, 2.9 × 102, 0 and 1.9 × 102 CFU respectively (Fig. 1).Table 2 The bacterial, fungal and actinomycetes strains isolated from marine samples\n\nMarine sample\tMicrobes isolated\t\nBacteria\tFungi\tActinomycetes\t\nCoastal sediments\tBCS1\tFCS1\tACS1\t\n\tBCS2\tFCS2\tACS2\t\n\tBCS3\t\t\t\n\tBCS4\t\t\t\nCrab\tBCB1\tFCB1\t–\t\n\tBCB2\tFCB2\t\t\nSepia\tBSP1\tFSP1\tASP1\t\n\tBSP2\tFSP2\tASP2\t\n\tBSP3\tFSP3\t\t\n\tBSP4\tFSP4\t\t\n\tBSP5\t\t\t\nLimpets\tBLM1\tFLM1\t–\t\n\tBLM2\tFLM2\t\t\n\tBLM3\t\t\t\nMacroalgae\tBMA1\tFMA1\tAMA1\t\n\tBMA2\tFMA2\tAMA2\t\n\tBMA3\t\t\t\n\tBMA4\t\t\t\n\tBMA5\t\t\t\n\tBMA6\t\t\t\n\tBMA7\t\t\t\n\tBMA8\t\t\t\n\tBMA9\t\t\t\n\n\nScreening of antibacterial activity of the isolated marine microorganisms\nOf the 23 bacteria isolated from different marine sources, only five (22 %) bacterial strains viz, BLM3, BSP2, BCS1, BCS4 and BMA6 showed inhibitory activity against at least one of the tested strains when detected by well-diffusion method. The results revealed that the isolate from coastal sediments (BCS4) exhibited a broad activity spectrum inhibiting both Gram positive (M. luteus and S. simulans) and Gram negative (Proteus vulgaris and two Vibrio sp. P3a and P3b) bacteria.\n\nThe spectrum of inhibitory activity was narrow for the four strains (BLM3, BSP2, BCS1 and BMA6) which inhibited either one of the indicator strains. The coastal sediment isolates BSP1 and BSP4 exhibited 100 % inhibition against the marine Vibrio sp. P3a with zone of inhibition of 25 and 31 mm respectively. None of the marine actinomycetes and fungal isolates showed inhibitory activity against the tested pathogens. Hence, the bacterial isolate BCS4 which showed the highest bioactivity was subjected to further molecular characterization and elution of antibacterial compound.\n\nThe isolated actinomycetes and fungi did not produce significant inhibition zones against the tested pathogens; however, the macroalgal isolated actinomycetes strain AMA1 produced reddish pigment in Starch Casein medium which remained stable till the stationary phase of growth (Fig. 2).Fig. 2 Antibacterial activity of Marine bacterial isolates\n\n\n\nGrowth characteristics and bioactive compound production by the bacterial isolate BCS4\nThe determination of growth of the potent marine isolate Bacillus sp. BCS4 revealed that the growth initiated after about 8 h of incubation, entered into the exponential phase after 24 h. The bacterium showed a steady growth till the 96th h after which it ceased to grow and entered the stationary phase followed by the decline. The steady rise in the growth rate indicated that the production of the metabolites maximized around 48 to 72 h (Fig. 3). The growth was followed by the production of bioactive metabolite which maximized at the 72th h of incubation and remained stable till the 96th h and decreased thereafter.Fig. 3 Growth characteristics andbioactive compound production of Marine bacterial isolate BCS4\n\n\n\nSolvent extraction of the bioactive compound\nAmong the solvents tested for better extraction of the bioactive compound, ethyl acetate extract gave wide zone of inhibition (Table 3) against the test strains indicating the superiority of ethyl acetate over other solvents in extracting the bioactive compound of BCS4 (Fig. 4).Table 3 Activity based extraction of the bioactive compound from Bacillus sp.

Distinct band was detected irrespective of the solvent systems, which is indicative of the presence of a compound in the crude extract. The Rf value was measured as 0.60, 0.72 and 0.79 cm for the solvent systems 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The ethyl acetate extracted compound eluted from the silica gel plate gave a zone of inhibition of 27.2 ± 0.3 mm against S. simulans MTCC 3610 confirming the bioactive potential.\n\nMolecular characterization of the active marine bacterial isolate\nThe bacterial strain BCS4 which inhibited majority of the tested pathogens was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the obtained sequence (749 bp) was blasted using Megablast tool of GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The blast results revealed 98 % similarity with the Bacillus sp. alk3. The phylogenetic tree was constructed through Neighbour Joining Method using Mega 6.0 software (Fig. 5). The active marine isolate was characterized as Bacillus sp. and designated Bacillus sp. BCS4.Fig. 5 Phylogenetic tree drawn in MEGA 6.0 software using Neighbour Joining Method\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe marine ecosystem is less harnessed in terms of developing alternative drugs to antibiotics. The rich diversity, along with extreme physical conditions makes marine environment an ideal source for proving novel drug leads. The coasts, Vizhinjam and Mulloor along the south-west coast of India harbour rich and biodiverse flora and fauna with millions of microorganisms associated with it. When compared to the terrestrial counterparts, these flora and fauna and the marine environment, in general possess novel drugs and other chemically diverse bioactives (Delong 2007). Though the percentage of culturable microbes remains too little, these can provide insights into the characteristics and potency of microbes (Glöckner et al. 2012) thriving in such extreme conditions.\n\nThe marine microbial biota is rich and diverse. The study on the diversity of microbes from coastal sediments and marine flora and fauna revealed that the percentage of bacteria isolated from the studied marine sources was comparatively higher than actinomycetes and fungi. While no actinomycetes were isolated from limpets and crab, at least two fungal strains were isolated from them. Similar observation was made by Tawiah et al. (2012) for the samples collected from Cape Coast Duakor Sea beach at Gulf of Guinea in which the frequency of bioactive producing bacteria was high compared to actinomycetes and fungi. The results from that study also revealed 27 % antibiotic producing microorganism out of 119 isolated recovered. These observations coincided with the observations of the present study which gave 22 % bioactive producing bacteria. On the contrary, high rate of isolation of antibiotic producers (70 %) was recorded by O’Brien et al. (2004) from the Amazon basin.\n\nThe highest number of active isolates was obtained from the coastal sediments collected from Vizhinjam coast. The increased number of active isolates in the sediments than from the marine flora and fauna studied might be attributed to fact that the area of sample collection being a Fish Landing area and prone to pollution with fish wastes and other waste discharges, the microbes there might have accustomed to thrive by producing defense compounds. The findings are supported by the observations of Tawiah et al. (2012). The study also revealed active compound producing bacteria and the absence of inhibitory potential by isolated Actinomycetes and Fungi. The absence of the zone of inhibition by the fungal and actinomycetes strains against the tested pathogens might be attributed to the changes in culture conditions or the limitations in the strains tested etc. Further, the actinomycetes and fungi require condition optimization for the production of the bioactive compounds. This would require the standardization of the culture conditions or supplementation with different media components to enrich the medium to enable the production of such compounds. The study carried out Kiranmayi et al. (2011) employed 11 different culture media in order to determine the best production media for the isolated actinomycetes. The variations noted in the antibiotic producers among the isolated strains may also be due to it’s dependence on the isolation and assay procedure, test organisms, type of media used and the sources of bacterial isolates (Giudice et al. 2007). A salient finding noted from the present study that the actinomycete strain AMA1 produced a reddish pigment in Starch-Casein medium which remained stable till the stationary phase of growth. Earlier reports evidenced the production of antitumour (Soliev et al. 2011; Olano et al. 2009), antibacterial (Pham et al. 2014) and other commercially important pigments from marine Actinomycetes. Studies also revealed prognosin like pigment production by Actinomycetes of marine origin (Quadri and Asgar 2012; Chaudhary et al. 2013). The studies on production and determination of the nature of the pigment produced by the strain AMA1 are needed further for characterization and evaluating it’s applicational potentiality.\n\nThe bacterial isolate from coastal sediments (BCS4) exhibited a broad activity spectrum inhibiting both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus simulans) and Gram negative (Proteus vulgaris and two Vibrio sp. P3a and P3b) bacteria. Similar broad activity spectrum was observed with marine Pseudoalteromonas species as was observed by Isnansetyo and Kamei (2003). The activity spectrum observed with the marine isolate in the study provides prospects for a future drug or bioactive lead. The growth pattern of the bacterial isolate revealed that the active metabolite production maximized at the late logarithmic phase (i.e., at the 72th h of incubation) and remained stable till the 96th h. Similar to this observation, Radhakrishna et al. (2011) noted maximum active metabolite production of sponge isolated Bacillus subtilis MTCC 10619 at the 72th h, which decreased thereafter.\n\nThe isolate with potent activity was phylogenetically confirmed as Bacillus sp. BCS4. It is evidenced from the reports of Mondol et al. (2013) that marine Bacillus isolates produce diverse bioactive metabolites with novel modes of action and has potentials for the development of effective management strategies to combat human, animal and phytopathogens in biorational manners. The activity spectrum noted for Bacillus sp. BCS4 is indicative of their possible medical and pharmaceutical applications. The compound was effectively extracted using the ethyl acetate solvent and the confirmation of the active compound in TLC provides insights into development of potent drugs out of this compound. Further work to detect the compound chemistry and the purification of the compound to homogeneity is under progress.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (JPEG 50 kb)\n\n Supplementary material 2 (JPEG 42 kb)\n\n Supplementary material 3 (JPEG 119 kb)\n\n \n\nThe present research work is part of the first author’s M.Sc. dissertation work.

The potential of a mangrove microorganism to utilize different natural waste carbon substrates for biosurfactant production and biodegradation of hydrocarbons was evaluated. Among several substrates used in the present study, orange peel was found to be best substrate of biosurfactant yield with 1.796 g/L and emulsification activity of 75.17 % against diesel. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of biosurfactant compound revealed that the isolated biosurfactant is in lipopeptide nature. The 1H-NMR of the extracted biosurfactant from B. licheniformis has a doublet signal at 0.8–0.9 ppm corresponding to six hydrogen atoms suggests the presence of a terminal isopropyl group. The spectra showed two main regions corresponding to resonance of α-carbon protons (3.5–5.5 ppm) and side-chain protons (0.25–3.0 ppm). All the data suggests that the fatty acid residue is from lipopeptide. From the biodegradation studies, it concluded that the biosurfactant produced by B. licheniformis further can add to its value as an ecofriendly and biodegradable product.\n\nKeywords\nBacillus licheniformisOrange peelsEmulsification activityLipopeptideNMR analysisissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nEnvironmental pollution with petroleum and petrochemical products has attracted much attention in recent decades. Microorganisms having the ability to degrade many poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been explained, and their mechanisms of action have been studied (Cerniglia 1992). The bioremediation of soils contaminated with PAHs is limited by the poor availability of these hydrophobic contaminants to microorganisms (Mihelcic et al. 1993). The presence of distinct types of automobiles and machinery has engendered in an increase in the use of lubricating oil. Spillage of used motor oils such as diesel or jet fuel contaminates our natural environment with hydrocarbon (Abioye et al. 2012). The illegal dumping of used motor oil is an environmental hazard with global ramifications (Blodgett 2001). Used motor oil contains metals and heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that could contribute to chronic hazards including mutagenicity and carcinogenicity (Hagwell et al. 1992; Boonchan et al. 2000). Microbial surface active agents or biosurfactants are extracellular products consisting of hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties and tend to interact with surfaces of different polarities and reduce the surface and interfacial tension of solutions, facilitating hydrocarbon uptake and emulsification/dispersion. They can improve the bioavailability of hydrocarbons to the microbial cells by increasing the area of contact at the aqueous–hydrocarbon interface. This increases the rate of hydrocarbon dissolution and their utilization by microorganisms (Singh et al. 2007; Satpute et al. 2010; Perfumo et al. 2006).\n\nGenerally biosurfactant production are using expensive carbon sources, it could be replaced with cheaply available natural raw materials. Agro-industrial wastes are with high contents of lipids and carbohydrates; it can be used as a carbon source for biosurfactant production (Makkar and Cameotra 2002). Mangroves ecosystems are the plant communities occurring in inter-tidal zones along the coasts of tropical and sub-tropical countries. Mangroves represent a rich and diverse living resource and are valuable to both the economy and protection of coastal environments. They have been considered as significant sinks for pollutions from freshwater discharges and from contaminated tidal water (Bernard et al. 1996; Reda and El Nagar 2009). However, the reports on biosurfactants produced by mangrove sediment microorganisms have been limited to date (Saimmai et al. 2012a, b, c). The objective of the present study was to produce biosurfactant from natural waste substrates by Bacillus licheniformis and evaluate their ability to degrade naphthalene and crude oil.\n\nMaterials and methods\nIsolation and identification of biosurfactant producing microorganisms\n100 g of mangrove sediment from coastal region of Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, India was collected at a depth of 0–5 cm. Initially, the bacterial consortium was enriched by adding 1 g of soil sample to 50 ml of minimal salt medium (MSM) in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 2 % glycerol as a carbon source (Arutchelvi and Doble 2010). Minimal salt medium composition (MSM) g/L: NaNO3—2.5, K2HPO4—1.0, KH2PO4—0.5, MgSO4—0.5, KCl—0.1, FeSO4—0.01, CaCl2—0.01, Glucose—30, pH—6.8 ± 0.2. The flasks were incubated at 150 rpm at 30 °C for 5 days. Thereafter, 1 ml aliquot of the culture broth was aliquoted to a fresh 50 ml MSM in a 250 ml flask and incubated under the same conditions as described above. This procedure was repeated three times. 1 ml of enriched cultures were diluted in a sterile 0.85 % saline solution and plated on nutrient agar plates for the isolation of microorganisms. Morphologically distinct colonies were re-isolated by transfer to nutrient agar plates thrice to obtain pure cultures and were subsequently gram-stained and selected for biochemical characterization and biosurfactant screening. Pure cultures were maintained in nutrient agar slants and stored at −20 °C.\n\nMolecular characterization of mangrove bacterial isolate\n16S rRNA sequencing was performed through an external agency (Macrogen Korea, Korea). The resulting sequences were compared with sequences in the GenBank database of NCBI using the BLAST network service (Altschul et al. 1997). Multiple sequence alignments were carried out using ClustalW and a consensus neighbor-joining tree was constructed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software (Tamura et al. 2007).\n\nScreening of potent biosurfactant producer\nThe potential biosurfactant producer was screened by different methods hemolytic assay, drop collapsing test, oil displacement test, and lipase activity (Abu-Ruwaida et al. 1991; Youssef et al. 2004; Kiran et al. 2009).\n\nSelection of optimum natural waste substrates for biosurfactant production\nTo evaluate optimum natural waste substrates as carbon sources for biosurfactant production such as Citrus lambiri peels, Citrus medica peels, orange peels, banana peels and potato peels were in the place of glycerol in MSM at the same concentration of 2 %. All these waste substrates were dried and powdered before use. All the experiments were carried out in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of the medium inoculated with 2 % (v/v) inoculum and incubated at 30 °C for 120 h. Fermented broth was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min for separation of supernatant.\n\nBiosurfactant production by using orange peel as carbon source\nThe effects of incubation time, temperature and substrate concentration were optimized. For all these experiments, 50 ml of the medium in 250-ml flask was inoculated with 2 % (v/v) of inoculum at 30 °C. The effect of incubation time on biosurfactant production was studied by incubating the medium between 1 and 5 days and the orange peel concentration was 2 %. The biosurfactant yield was evaluated at regular intervals of 24 h and the minimum period for maximum biosurfactant production was selected as the optimum incubation time. The biosurfactant production was also checked at different temperature conditions i.e., 25, 30, 35, 40 °C. The effect of concentration of orange peel was optimized between 1 and 5 %.\n\nExtraction of biosurfactant\nCell pellet was removed from the fermented broth by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. To precipitate the lipids and proteins, 6 N HCl was added to the culture supernatant to bring final pH of 2.0 and kept for overnight at 4 °C. Then the precipitated biosurfactants was extracted by adding equal volumes of ethyl acetate in a separating funnel and shaken vigorously. The organic phase was subjected to rota-evaporation for extraction of biosurfactant. The extracted biosurfactant was lyophilized and weighed for determination of biosurfactant yield.\n\nStudy of growth and biosurfactant production\nThe analysis of growth and biosurfactant production were studied in different carbon substrates containing MSM in 250 ml conical flask with 50 ml working volume. Fermented broth were collected every alternate hour and checked for biomass, biosurfactant concentration and emulsification activity. Biomass was determined by dry cell weight method (Suwansukho et al. 2008). Emulsification activity was measured by adding equal volumes of hydrocarbon and culture supernatant mixed and vortexed for 2 min followed by incubation at room temperature for 24 h (Tabatabaee et al. 2005).\n\nChemical characterization of biosurfactant\nTLC analysis for crude biosurfactant\nThe extracted crude biosurfactants of B. licheniformis were examined using thin layer chromatography (TLC). Approximately 100 µL of each sample was applied to a preparative TLC (20 cm × 20 cm), with silica-gel 60 in chloroform–methanol–acetic acid (65:15:2, v/v/v). The lateral edges of the plate were sprayed with orcinol–H2SO4 (Monteiro et al. 2007) and developed at 100 °C for 5 min. Positive spots were scraped and then extracted with 3 ml of chloroform–methanol (2:1, v/v, twice), with centrifugation at 3000×g to remove the silica gel.\n\nHigh pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis\nThe purity of the separated component was tested by gradient elution high-performance liquid chromatography using a Waters C 18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) with a Waters 717 plus auto sampler and 2487 refractive index detector. The flow rate was 0.4 ml min−1, and the mobile phase used was acetone/acetonitrile (30:70 v/v). The injected sample volume was 20 µl.\n\nIdentification of fatty acid and amino acid\nThe presence of fatty acid and amino acid in biosurfactant were identified by the method (Feignier et al. 1995). Protein content was determined (Lowry et al. 1951). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as calibration standard.\n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used for the molecular characterization of the biosurfactant. Lyophilized samples were analyzed by KBr pellet method.\n\nBiodegradation of PAH compounds (naphthalene) and crude oil\nBacterium was grown in a batch culture in a two different 250 ml flask containing 50 ml of MSM supplemented with PAH, i.e., Naphthalene (100 mg) in one flask and in another flask with crude oil (500 µl) as a sole carbon source and these flasks were inoculated with 2 % overnight broth culture. The conical flask was kept in shaker at 150 rpm at 37 °C for 10 days. At the regular time intervals, flasks were taken out and 1 ml culture was withdrawn for OD measurements at 600 nm and the same broth was used to estimate the end product of naphthalene biodegradation, i.e., salicylic acid and another flask containing broth for crude oil degradation studies.\n\nAnalysis of naphthalene intermediate\nThe concentration of hydroxylated aromatic metabolites from naphthalene degradation was determined (Box 1983). As it was expected that the major metabolite in naphthalene degradation is salicylic acid, a standard graph was prepared by using sodium salicylate. The concentration of hydroxylated metabolic intermediates was estimated as salicylic acid equivalents in mg/ml.\n\nEstimation of crude oil degradation\nCrude oil concentrations were determined as follows: crude oil samples were mixed with equal volume of petroleum ether to extract crude oil. Then the extracted crude oil was detected spectrophotometrically at 228 nm (Rahman et al. 2002).\n\nBacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons (BATH assay)\nThe Cell hydrophobicity of the B. licheniformis with crude oil was measured using the BATH assay (Rosenberg et al. 1980). Hydrophobicity is expressed as the percentage of cell adherence to crude oil was calculated as follows: Percentage of bacterial adherence%=1-ODaqueous\\, phaseODoriginal×100 \n\nStatistical analysis\nAll the biosurfactant production experiments were carried out in three parallel replicates and the results presented were the average values of three determinations. The standard deviations for all measurements were less than 5 %.\n\nResults and discussion\nIsolation, screening and identification of biosurfactant-producing microorganism\nA Gram-positive, endospore-forming, rodshaped bacterium with bacillar morphology was isolated from mangrove sediment of Kakinada mangrove region in Andhra Pradesh, India. The sequence of the 16S rRNA of the isolated bacteria demonstrated a high degree of similarity (99 %) with B. licheniformis (Fig. 1). The 16S rRNA sequences of strain B. licheniformis determined and submitted to GenBank database with accession numbers KC710973.Fig. 1 Phylogenetic tree of the strain Bacillus licheniformis and closest NCBI (BLASTn) strains based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences (neighbor joining tree method). The scale bar indicates 0.0005 nucleotide substitutions per nucleotide position. The numbers at node show the bootstrap values\n\n\n\nIn the present study, the bacterial isolates were first screened with preliminary screening method for determining hemolytic activity. B. licheniformis showed good hemolytic activity. Blood agar lysis has been used to quantify surfactin (Moran et al. 2002; Rosenberg et al. 1980) and rhamnolipids (Johnson and Boese-Marrazzo 1980) and has been used to screen biosurfactant production by new isolates (Carrillo et al. 1996; Banat 1993). Carrillo et al. (1996) and Saimmai et al. (2012b) found an association between hemolytic activity and surfactant production, and they recommended the use of blood agar lysis as a primary method to screen biosurfactant production. None of the studies reported in the literature mention the possibility of biosurfactant production without a hemolytic activity (Moran et al. 2002; Johnson and Boese-Marrazzo 1980; Carrillo et al. 1996; Banat 1993). However, in some cases hemolytic assay excluded many good biosurfactant producers (Youssef et al. 2004).\n\nThe supernatant from B. licheniformis have shown good activity of 8 mm in diameter oil displacement activity and positive result in oil collapse method. The presence of biosurfactant was determined by oil displacement and clearing zone formation. The diameter of this clearing zone on the oil surface correlates to surfactant activity and hence satisfies oil displacement activity. Youssef et al. (2004), demonstrated that the oil spreading technique was very reliable method to detect biosurfactant production by diversified microorganisms.\n\nIn the lipase screening activity, B. licheniformis showed positive lipolytic activity (Fig. 2). Inoculation of the bacterial isolates on Tributyrin agar plate produced a clear zone which indicates production of the enzyme, i.e., lipase. These results confirmed that the bacterial isolates were potential producers of surface active molecules. According to Kokare et al. (2007), lipase acts on water–oil surfaces and therefore it was suggested that actinomycetes showed the presence of lipases and are able to produce bioemulsifiers.Fig. 2 Lipolytic activity of mangrove bacterial isolate B. licheniformis\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of biosurfactant production by B. licheniformis\nBiosurfactant production from B. licheniformis with different natural waste substrates as carbon sources was studied using a mineral salt medium. The composition (g/L) of mineral salt medium prepared in distilled water was as follows: NH4NO3 (1.0); KH2PO4 (1.0); K2HPO4 (1.0); MgSO4·7H2O (0.2); CaCl2·2H2O (0.2) and FeCl3·6H2O (0.05). Among the five substrates tested, the highest percentage of emulsification and biosurfactant yield was obtained on using orange peels used as carbon source and the lowest emulsification index was found on Citrus lambiri peels (Table 1). Especially for Citrus lambiri and Citrus medica peels, the biosurfactant concentration of 0.876 and 0.809 g/L was recorded, respectively, but the emulsification activity of 22.56 and 26.04 % was measured, respectively. The yield was quite good using citrus peels but the emulsification activity was decreased. Similarly George and Jayachandran (2009), was reported when lime peelings used as a carbon source that the emulsification activity was not proportional to the biosurfactant yield. Based on these studies the orange peel was used for further studies as a carbon source to enhance the biosurfactant production.Table 1 Biosurfactant produced from B. licheniformis with different natural waste substrates\n\nSubstrates\tBiosurfactant concentration (g/L)*\tEmulsification activity (%)*\t\nCitrus lambiri peels\t0.876 ± 0.068\t22.56 ± 2.881\t\nCitrus medica peels\t0.809 ± 0.065\t26.04 ± 2.713\t\nOrange peels\t1.295 ± 0.007\t70.78667 ± 1.066\t\nBanana peels\t1.116 ± 0.103\t66.49333 ± 0.854\t\nPotato peels\t1.058 ± 0.150\t65.46667 ± 1.285\t\n* Mean ± SD, no = 3\n\n\n\nThe growth and biosurfactant production by B. licheniformis was monitored in mineral salts medium at different time intervals. B. licheniformis actively produced biosurfactants in the exponential growth phase and it was completed within 72 h there onwards decreased gradually in orange peel containing media (Fig. 3). Maximum emulsification activity and biosurfactant yield of 70.87 % and 1.41 g/L was obtained at 96 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 3). The biosurfactant production was significantly increased with the increase in the orange peel concentration and obtained the maximum yield of 1.796 g/L and emulsification activity of 75.17 when 4 % orange peel as a carbon source (Table 2). The optimum temperature for maximum biosurfactant yield was found at 30 °C and there onwards the biosurfactant production was decreased with increase in temperature (Table 2).Fig. 3 Effect of incubation time on biomass, biosurfactant yield and emulsification activity\n\nTable 2 Effect of different orange peel concentration on Emulsification activity and biosurfactant production by B. licheniformis\n\n\nOrange peel concentration (%)\tEmulsification index (%)*\tBiosurfactant yield (g/L)*\tTemperature (°C)\tEmulsification index (%)* \tBiosurfactant yield (g/L)*\t\n1\t60.38 ± 1.615\t0.78 ± 0.052\t25\t57.84 ± 2.408\t0.621 ± 0.038\t\n2\t71.08 ± 1.076\t1.232 ± 0.072\t30\t70.75 ± 1.051\t1.283 ± 0.020\t\n3\t71.97 ± 1.279\t1.387 ± 0.051\t35\t69.55 ± 0.852\t1.193 ± 0.015\t\n4\t75.17 ± 0.390\t1.796 ± 0.011\t40\t60.06 ± 1.014\t0.862 ± 0.017\t\n5\t73.21 ± 1.098\t1.585 ± 0.099\t45\t19.58 ± 0.854\t0.146 ± 0.015\t\n* Mean ± SD, no = 3\n\n\n\nCharacterization of biosurfactant from B. licheniformis\nTLC and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis\nThe crude biosurfactant obtained after solvent extraction from the culture supernatant of B. licheniformis was further purified by different chromatographic techniques. Crude extract of the biosurfactant was recovered from the culture supernatant of bacterial isolate by ethyl acetate extraction process. After acid precipitation crude biosurfactant was examined and separated using thin layer chromatography (TLC). Single spot was observed at an Rf value 0.56. The TLC fraction was further successfully purified by HPLC column at different elution times and is presented in Fig. 4. In HPLC analysis, three peaks were observed at retention times of 2.3, 2.5 and 2.8. The purified fraction was analyzed for further characterization of biosurfactant from B. licheniformis.Fig. 4 HPLC chromatogram of the TLC fraction from B. licheniformis\n\n\n\n\nBiochemical composition of biosurfactant produced by B. licheniformis\nThe biosurfactant compound showed negative result towards the bromine water reaction indicating that the fatty acid chain was saturated. In the same way it showed negative result to ninhydrin reaction indicating that the peptide has a blocked N-terminal. Biuret reaction was positive indicates the presence of polypeptides. The above results indicate that the biosurfactant has a lipopeptide in nature. Similar types of findings were reported in B. subtilis producing lipopeptide (Ishigami 1997; Dehghan-Noudeh et al. 2005).\n\nFTIR analysis of biosurfactant\nThe IR spectrum analysis of biosurfactant from B. licheniformis showed strong bands, indicating the presence of a peptide component at 3280.92 cm−1 resulting from the N–H stretching mode, at 1627.92 cm−1 resulting from the stretching mode of the CO–N bond, and at 1535.34 cm−1 resulting from the deformation mode of the N–H bond combined with the C–N stretching mode. The bands at 2958–2856 and 1384 cm−1 resulting from the C–H stretching mode suggest the presence of an aliphatic chain. These results were strong evidence that lipopeptide contains aliphatic and peptide likes moieties. The band at 1735 cm−1 was due to lactone carbonyl absorption (Fig. 5). These patterns were similar to those of lipopeptide compound, i.e., surfactin and lichenysin (Yakimov et al. 1995; Lin et al. 1998; Joshi et al. 2008).Fig. 5 FTIR spectrum analysis of biosurfactant produced by B. licheniformis\n\n\n\n\nNMR spectroscopy analysis of biosurfactant from a culture of B. licheniformis\nThe 1H-NMR of the extracted biosurfactant from B. licheniformis is presented in Fig. 6. A doublet signal at 0.8–0.9 ppm corresponding to six hydrogen atoms suggests the presence of a terminal isopropyl group. The assignments of other signals are given in Fig. 6. The spectra showed two main regions corresponding to resonance of α-carbon protons (3.5–5.5 ppm) and side-chain protons (0.25–3.0 ppm) (Peypoux et al. 1991; Chen and Juang 2008).Fig. 6 Chemical shift assignments of biosurfactant in 1H NMR spectra produced by B. licheniformis\n\n\n\n\nThe chemical shift at 4.1 ppm observed in the extracted biosurfactant from B. licheniformis is similar with that observed in 1H NMR spectra of lipopeptide monoesters previously reported in literature (Tang et al. 2007; Kowall et al. 1998; Liu et al. 2009), thus suggesting the presence of one O-CH3 group. The presence of the methyl esters in the structure of surfactins has been related with an increase of its hydrophobicity and, consequently an increment of their surfactant powers, antifungal and hemolytic activities (Kowall et al. 1998). On the other hand, a chemical shift at 5.01 ppm was observed which corresponds to the H-3 (terminal proton) of the fatty acid chain, which has also been previously observed by other authors (Kowall et al. 1998; Liu et al. 2009). All the data suggests that the fatty acid residue from lipopeptide.\n\nBiodegradation studies of naphthalene and crude oil\nIn this study, the potent bacterial isolate B. licheniformis were used for the naphthalene degradation studies. The bacterial degradation of naphthalene was quantified indirectly by the determination of naphthalene polar intermediates, i.e., salicylic acid. Accumulation of the major metabolite salicylic acid was started slowly by day 1 onwards and it reached maximum at 6th day of incubation for B. licheniformis and later it was decreased (Fig. 7a). In the earlier studies, the production of biosurfactants by microorganisms which can reduce the surface tension of the broth and subsequently increases the bioavailability of the naphthalene to the bacteria. In general the mechanism of aerobic degradation of Naphthalene involves the incorporation of molecular oxygen into one of the aromatic rings by Naphthalene dioxygenase, leading to the formation of cis-1,2-Naphthalene dihydrodiol. The later undergoes a number of further degradative steps and finally gets metabolized to carbon dioxide through salicylic acid (Seo et al. 2009). Naphthalene biodegradation is the best studied PAHs because it has simple structure and most soluble in nature and naphthalene-degrading microorganisms are relatively easy to isolate. Recently Dasari et al. (2014), reported that P. aeruginosa degrade the naphthalene in presence of biosurfactant at 6th day of incubation.Fig. 7 Biodegradation of naphthalene (a) and crude oil (b) by B. licheniformis\n\n\n\n\nIn the crude oil degradation studies, it showed high degradation levels (Fig. 7b). Simultaneously, we also checked the growth of the organism. In the growth study, B. licheniformis showed maximum growth at 4th day of incubation and later onwards the growth was declined. Generally microorganisms can convert the crude oil chemical compounds into for their energy, cell mass and biological products (Zhang et al. 2005). Based on these biodegradation studies B. licheniformis adds to its value as an ecofriendly and biodegradable product. Mohammad et al. (1985), stated that the biosurfactant produced from B. licheniformis JF-2 has ability to enhanced oil recovery process.\n\nThe maximum percentage of bacterial adherence of 32.57 % was reported by B. licheniformis with crude oil. The BATH assay was confirmed by visualization of cells adhered to crude oil and it was confirmed by the affinity of cells towards crude oil facilitated by producing biosurfactant (Thavasi et al. 2008). The hydrocarbon degraders normally produce surfactants which adhere effectively to hydrophobic substrate (Nishanthi et al. 2010). Pruthi and Cameotra (1997), showed that the ability of bacteria to adhere to hydrocarbons is a characteristic feature of biosurfactant producing microbes. According to Thavasi et al. (2011), the bacterial isolates with high hydrophobicity are likely to be more efficient degraders. Franzetti et al. (2009) stated that the cell hydrophobicity is also an indication of biosurfactant production.\n\nConclusion\nA Gram-positive bacterium was isolated from mangrove sediment soil and it was identified as B. licheniformis with an accession number KC710973. The orange peel substrate was utilized by B. licheniformis as a very effective carbon source and biosurfactant production. From HPLC, FTIR and NMR studies the biosurfactant revealed that the compound was lipopeptide. From the biodegradation studies, it concluded that the biosurfactant produced by B. licheniformis further can add to its value as an ecofriendly and biodegradable product.\n\nThe authors are thankful to Department of Virology, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India, for providing laboratory facilities.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nWe are declaring that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this article.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAbioye OP  Agamuthu P  Abdul Aziz AR   Biodegradation of used motor oil in soil using organic waste amendments Biotechnol Res Int 2012 \nAbu-Ruwaida AS  Banat IM  Haditirto S  Salem A  Kadri M   Isolation of biosurfactant-producing bacteria product characterization and evaluation Act Biotechnologica 1991 11 315 324 10.1002/abio.370110405 \nAltschul SF  Thomas LM  Alejandro AS  Zhang JH  Zhang Z  Webb M    Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs Nucleic Acids Res 1997 25 3389 3402 10.1093/nar/25.17.3389 9254694 \nArutchelvi J  Doble M   Characterization of glycolipid biosurfactant from Pseudomonas aeruginosa  CPCL isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil Lett Appl Microbiol 2010 51 75 82 20477962 \nBanat IM   The isolation of a thermophilic biosurfactant producing Bacillus  sp.

Formation of correct disulfide bonds are must for achieving native conformation, solubility and activity. Production of recombinant proteins containing disulfide bond for therapeutic, diagnostic and various other purposes is a challenging task of research. Production of such proteins in the reducing cytosolic compartment of E. coli usually ends up in inclusion bodies formation. Refolding of inclusion bodies can be difficult, time and labor consuming and uneconomical. Translocation of these proteins into the oxidative periplasmic compartment provides correct environment to undergo proper disulfide bonds formation and thus achieving native conformation. However, not all proteins can be efficiently translocated to the periplasm with the help of bacterial signal peptides. Therefore, fusion to a small well-folded and stable periplasmic protein is more promising for periplasmic production of disulfide bonded proteins. In the past decades, several full-length proteins or domains were used for enhancing translocation and solubility. Here, protein fusion tags that significantly increase the yields of target proteins in the periplasmic space are reviewed.\n\nKeywords\nFusion proteinPeriplasmic spaceProtein foldingSolubility enhancerNational Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (MAARIFAH), King Abdulaziz city for Science and Technology, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia12-MED-2932Malik Ajamaluddin issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nSince the advent of production of recombinant proteins, application of therapeutic and diagnostic proteins as biopharmaceuticals was changed remarkably (Walsh 2014). These proteins are required in huge amount and usually can not be obtained from natural sources due to extremely low availability. Moreover, Genetically engineered proteins with special benefits (e.g. Insulin analogs) are as such molecules which can therefore only be obtained via recombinant technology (Walsh 2000, 2006; Sanchez and Demain 2012). Escherichia coli was the first and still popularly used host for the fast and economical production of recombinant proteins (Vincentelli and Romier 2013; Chance et al. 1981; Choi and Lee 2004; Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014; Lebendiker and Danieli 2014). In-depth knowledge of genetic and biochemical pathways of E. coli and availability of variety of vectors made is an attractive host for such purposes. Although significant improvements have been made at transcription, translation and translocation, still obtaining soluble and bioactive proteins is a major challenge (Pines and Inouye 1999; Baneyx 1999; Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014).\n\nSecreted proteins such as antibodies, enzymes, hormones etc. are used for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Secreted proteins having two or more cysteines makes disulfide bonds, which is usually vital for structure formation and bioactivity (Creighton 1997b; Creighton et al. 1995; Clarke and Fersht 1993). The cytosol of E. coli is reducing which gives inclusion bodies when such proteins are expressed in the cytosol (Freedman 1989; Hwang et al. 1992; Aslund et al. 1994; Carmel-Harel and Storz 2000; Russel 1995; Messens and Collet 2006). Usually in vitro oxidative refolding is difficult, laborious, time consuming and may be uneconomical depending upon refolding yield (Lilie et al. 1998; Lange and Rudolph 2009; Yamaguchi et al. 2013; Basu et al. 2011). Translocation of these proteins into the E. coli periplasm provides favorable environment for oxidative folding due to the presence of disulfide bond folding and isomerization machinery (Gopal and Kumar 2013; Yoon et al. 2010; Choi and Lee 2004). Moreover, proteases are less abundant in periplasm and also its relatively less crowded than cytosol which reduces the chances of proteolysis and ease in the purification of recombinant proteins (Makrides 1996). To secrete proteins into periplasmic space, a translocation signal sequence must be fused at the N terminus of proteins, but only the fusion of signal sequence is not enough for efficient protein translocation (Fekkes and Driessen 1999; Muller et al. 2001). The sequences on mature protein next to the signal peptidase cut site and other parts of mature protein play an important role in the secretion (Lee et al. 1989; Malik et al. 2006). Under such condition, fusion to a full-length periplasmic protein that is well stable, soluble and properly folded is more promising (Table 1).Table 1 Properties of periplasmic fusion proteins\n\nFusion protein\tMW (kDa)\tcalc. pI\tS–S bond\tSubcellular location\t\nEcotin\t16\t5.94\t1\tPeriplasm\t\nMaltose-binding protein\t40.7\t5.07\t0\tPeriplasm\t\nZ-domain of protein A\t6.6\t5.16\t0\tSecreted\t\nABD-domain of protein G\t6\t4.46\t0\tSecreted\t\nCBD from exonuclease\t11.1\t8.44\t1\tSecreted\t\nCBD from endonuclease\t10.9\t6.07\t1\tSecreted\t\nDisulfide bond oxidoreductase\t21.1\t5.42\t1\tPeriplasm\t\nBarnase\t12.3\t8.88\t0\tSecreted\t\nSize, calculated isoelectric point, number of disulfide bond and native localization were evaluated\n\n\n\nOver two decades of extensive in vivo and in vitro research on protein fusions constructs concluded that fusion tags usually increases the yield and solubility of their fusion partners (Costa et al. 2014; Waugh 2005). Despite all these advancement, still it is difficult to choose the best fusion system for a given protein of interest. In general, selection of fusion tag depends upon the properties of protein of interest itself such as size, stability, and hydrophobicity; the expression site; and the usage of the recombinant protein. After coupling with second protein (fusion tag) the increase in yield and solubility the target proteins varies in each fusions. The detailed mechanism by which fusion proteins improve solubility and yield is not well understood. There is two hypotheses: (a) fusion of a stable or conserved structure to an insoluble recombinant protein may serve to stabilize and promote proper folding of the recombinant protein (Butt et al. 2005) and (b) fusion tags may act as a nucleus of folding “molten globule hypothesis” (Creighton 1997a).\n\nIdeally, an effective periplasmic fusion system should have the following features: (a) efficient translocator; (b) enhance folding and solubility; (c) help in purification; (d) facilitate quantification; (e) minimize proteolysis; (f) no adverse effect on the structure and bioactivity; (g) easy and specific removal of the fusion tag; (h) useful for different classes of proteins and peptides. However, none of the fusion tag is optimal with respect to all of these parameters. Successful examples of each periplasmic fusion proteins are listed in Table 2. In the following sections, merits and demerits of available periplasmic fusion proteins are discussed.Table 2 Examples of protein fusion tag assisted production of recombinant proteins in the periplasmic space of E. coli\n\n\nFusion protein\tModel protein\tReferences\t\nEcotin\tPepsinogen\tMalik et al.

The properties of ecotin make it a promising periplasmic fusion tag. It is moderately small in size (16 kDa monomer), extremely stable (tolerates pH 1.0 and 100 °C for 30 min) and contains one disulfide bond in each subunit (Chung et al. 1983). Due to the presence of disulfide bonds, ecotin undergoes a pathway of oxidative folding.\n\nNaturally, ecotin is constitutively expressed (Chung et al. 1983) for the defense of E. coli against trypsin like serine proteases in the digestive tract and neutrophil elastase like serine proteases in the blood. Ecotin had no metabolic role or interaction with other proteins in E. coli (Eggers et al. 2004). The C termini of each monomer in dimeric ecotin protrude in opposite directions (Fig. 1a), which will allow folding of passenger proteins at each end without steric hindrance. Strong affinity of ecotin’s for trypsin like serine protease will facilitate ecotin fusion protein to purify via affinity chromatography. Ecotin’s binding surface has been already randomized (Stoop and Craik 2003) to reduce its affinity to zymogens of serine proteases, which would help to elute ecotin fusion proteins under softer conditions.Fig. 1 Three-dimensional structure of periplasmic fusion proteins. a ecotin (1ECZ), b Maltose binding protein (1DMB), c Z-domain of protein A (1LP1), d ABD-domain of protein G (1EM7), e CBD of endoglucanase (1EXG), f CBD of exoglucanase (modelled 3D structure), g disulfide bond oxidoreductase (1A2J), h Barnase (1RNB)\n\n\n\nMoreover, model protein in the ecotin fusion system can be quantatively measured in a very sensitive trypsin inhibition assays (Kang et al. 2005). Even in the cytosol ecotin is stable and active; which makes it suitable candidate to be used as cytoplasmic fusion tag (Kang et al. 2005). Ecotin can also be produced in monomeric native state after removal of the last 10 residues (Pal et al. 1996) Thus, ecotin fusion protein in monomeric state is feasible. Ecotin fusion tag have been used for efficient translocation, solubility enhancement and purification of proteins and peptides (Paal et al. 2009; Malik et al. 2006, 2007).\n\nMaltose-binding protein\nMaltose-binding protein (MBP) is cysteine-less relatively large (40.6 kDa) periplasmic protein (Fig. 1b) (Duplay et al. 1984). It is known for its noteworthy solubility enhancement when it is fused at the N terminus of model proteins (Raran-Kurussi et al. 2015; Raran-Kurussi and Waugh 2012; Sachdev and Chirgwin 1998). MBP has been frequently utilized for cytosolic expression but due to its natural periplasmic localization, it is also utilized as periplasmic fusion tag for enhancing secretion, solubility as well as purification of target proteins (Salema and Fernandez 2013; Planson et al. 2003). In certain cases, it was found that MBP attains natively folded state and remains soluble while the passenger proteins could not attained properly folded state and exist as in the state of soluble aggregates (Nallamsetty et al. 2005; Nomine et al. 2001; Sachdev and Chirgwin 1999). The affinity of MBP for maltose is ~1 μM which allowed to purify MBP fusion protein through affinity chromatography (Betton and Hofnung 1996). Moreover, MBP is thermodynamically moderately stable with the Tm of 62.8 °C at pH 8.3 (Novokhatny and Ingham 1997) and individual components of MBP fusions are slightly more stable than their counterparts in the fusion protein (Blondel et al. 1996).\n\nStaphylococcal protein A\nStaphylococcal protein A (SpA) is a surface protein of Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus which has strong affinity and high specificity for constant (Fc) part of human immunoglobulins as well as large number of other animals (Eliasson et al. 1988; Cedergren et al. 1993). SpA is a highly soluble 31 kDa protein. Chemically denatured SpA renatures efficiently which assists refolding of the target protein in the SpA fusion system (Samuelsson et al. 1991). SpA is a cysteine-less protein, thus abolishing the chances of interference in disulfide bond formation with fused protein of interest (Kashimura et al. 2013; Uhlen et al. 1984). The gene of SpA is highly repetitive which consists of signal sequence followed by five small highly similar domains (E, D, A, B and C) and C terminal membrane anchoring sequence. The B-domain has been engineered to create smaller variants (7 kDa) of SpA, called as Z-domain (Nilsson et al. 1987). Depending upon localization requirements of the target protein, large number of expression plasmids with or without signal sequences for the production of single Z-domain (7 kDa) or double Z-domains (14 kDa) fusions (Fig. 1c) has been developed (Nilsson et al. 1994, 1996; Hammarberg et al. 1989; Stahl et al. 1989). The fusion protein with Z-domain was more efficiently translocated in comparison to full length SpA proteins (Nilsson et al. 1997).\n\nStreptococcal protein G\nStreptococcal protein G (SpG) present on the streptococci surface is a bifunctional receptor and capable of binding with both IgG and serum albumin from different species with different affinities (Nygren et al. 1988). The IgG and albumin binding regions are structurally separated on the SpG. The serum albumin binding region is known as ABD (albumin-binding domain), consists of three binding motifs (each ~5 kDa) (Fig. 1d). Depending upon the localization of the target proteins, ABD with or without signal sequence has been used for expression of fusion protein. Subsequently, fusion proteins were purified via HSA-affinity chromatography in one-step (Hammarberg et al. 1989; Larsson et al. 1996; Stahl et al. 1989).\n\nCellulose binding domain (CBD)\nNearly 111 residues from endoglucanase (Fig. 1e) and 100 residues from exoglucanase (Fig. 1f) of Cellulomonas fimi, which has high affinity for cellulose, have been used for translocation to periplasmic space and solubility enhancement of target proteins (Gilkes et al. 1988, 1992; Warren et al. 1986; Hwang et al. 2004; Hasenwinkle et al. 1997; Creagh et al. 1996; Ong et al. 1991). The purification of cellulose binding domain fusion protein was achieved via relatively inexpensive ligand matrix (cellulose) (Greenwood et al. 1989, 1992; Ong et al. 1991).\n\nDisulfide bond oxidoreductase\nDisulfide bond oxidoreductase (DsbA) is the key enzyme of periplasmic oxidoreductive system (Fig. 1g). It facilitates correct disulfide bond formation via intra- and intermolecular catalysis (Bardwell et al. 1993). In biotechnological applications, target proteins having multiple disulfide bonds (enterokinase catalytic subunit, proinsulin) were fused at the C terminus of DsbA to enhance disulfide bond formation as well as stabilize unfolded target protein via its polypeptide binding site (Collinsracie et al. 1995; Winter et al. 2000). After fusion with DsbA, these proteins were obtained in the well-folded soluble state in the periplasmic space. DsbA is a potent protein thiol oxidase. It has been observed in vitro experiments that DsbA causes non-native disulfide bond formation in proteins having multiple disulfide bonds (Hirudin, BPTI) (Wunderlich and Glockshuber 1993; Zapun and Creighton 1994). Also, in vivo co-expression of DsbA resulted in inclusion bodies formation of IGF-I (Joly et al. 1998).\n\nBarnase\nBarnase is an enzymatically inactive variant (H102A) of extracellular RNAse from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Fig. 1h). It is monomeric, cysteine-less protein of relatively small size. For biotechnological applications, enzymatically inactive variant of RNAse was used as a fusion protein to enhance the secretion of cysteine-knot peptides in the periplasmic space. It was found that majority of the cysteine-knot peptides were in the native state when fused with barnase (Schmoldt et al. 2005). Moreover, the Barnase fusion protein could be purified via immobilized barstar (Barnase inhibitor) in single step (Schmoldt et al. 2005).\n\nConclusion\nEvery protein is unique and due to their different applications such as academic research, diagnostic or therapeutic usage, the quantity and purity level vary. Therefore, no single fusion tag will address every requirement. Fusion tags are helpful in enhancing their solubility and stability. Protein fusion tag with μM-nM ligand affinity generally results in 90–99 % purity after affinity chromatography. Removal of protein fusion tag and producing recombinant protein with authentic N terminal adds another layer of complexity. When considering which protein fusion to use, important queries should keep in mind such as: nature of protein itself, how much protein required, application of protein, is fusion tag removal necessary or not, how much additional residues could be tolerated at N terminal? To remove most part of the fusion protein, highly specific protease cleavage site (TEV protease, thrombin, enterokinase, etc.) could be placed in the linker region between fusion tag and model protein. Also, non-specific proteases such as trypsin could be used to generate authentic N terminus as demonstrated in the case of Ecotin-proinsulin fusion protein (Malik et al. 2007). If authentic N terminus is must for the application, ubiquitin fusion technology could be used as successfully demonstrated in ecotin–ubiquitin–peptide fusion system (Paal et al. 2009).\n\n\nThis study was funded by the National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (MAARIFAH), King Abdulaziz city for Science and Technology, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Award Number (12-MED-2932).\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nI confirm that there is no known conflict of interest associated with this review article.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAslund F  Ehn B  Miranda-Vizuete A  Pueyo C  Holmgren A   Two additional glutaredoxins exist in Escherichia coli : glutaredoxin 3 is a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase in a thioredoxin/glutaredoxin 1 double mutant Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1994 91 21 9813 9817 10.1073/pnas.91.21.9813 7937896 \nBaneyx F   Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli  Curr Opin Biotechnol 1999 10 5 411 421 10.1016/S0958-1669(99)00003-8 10508629 \nBardwell JC  Lee JO  Jander G  Martin N  Belin D  Beckwith J   A pathway for disulfide bond formation in vivo Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1993 90 3 1038 1042 10.1073/pnas.90.3.1038 8430071 \nBasu A  Li X  Leong SS   Refolding of proteins from inclusion bodies: rational design and recipes Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 2011 92 2 241 251 10.1007/s00253-011-3513-y 21822901 \nBetton JM  Hofnung M   Folding of a mutant maltose-binding protein of Escherichia coli  which forms inclusion bodies J Biol Chem 1996 271 14 8046 8052 10.1074/jbc.271.14.8046 8626487 \nBlondel A  Nageotte R  Bedouelle H   Destabilizing interactions between the partners of a bifunctional fusion protein Protein Eng 1996 9 2 231 238 10.1093/protein/9.2.231 9005445 \nButt TR  Edavettal SC  Hall JP  Mattern MR   SUMO fusion technology for difficult-to-express proteins Protein Expr Purif 2005 43 1 1 9 10.1016/j.pep.2005.03.016 16084395 \nCarmel-Harel O  Storz G   Roles of the glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent reduction systems in the Escherichia coli  and saccharomyces cerevisiae responses to oxidative stress Annu Rev Microbiol 2000 54 439 461 10.1146/annurev.micro.54.1.439 11018134 \nCedergren L  Andersson R  Jansson B  Uhlen M  Nilsson B   Mutational analysis of the interaction between staphylococcal protein-a and human Igg(1) Protein Eng 1993 6 4 441 448 10.1093/protein/6.4.441 8332602 \nChance RE  Kroeff EP  Hoffmann JA  Frank BH   Chemical, physical, and biologic properties of biosynthetic human insulin Diabetes Care 1981 4 2 147 154 10.2337/diacare.4.2.147 7011716 \nChoi JH  Lee SY   Secretory and extracellular production of recombinant proteins using Escherichia coli  Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 2004 64 5 625 635 10.1007/s00253-004-1559-9 14966662 \nChung CH  Ives HE  Almeda S  Goldberg AL   Purification from Escherichia coli  of a periplasmic protein that is a potent inhibitor of pancreatic proteases J Biol Chem 1983 258 18 1032 1038 6296066 \nClarke J  Fersht AR   Engineered disulfide bonds as probes of the folding pathway of Barnase—increasing the stability of proteins against the rate of denaturation Biochemistry 1993 32 16 4322 4329 10.1021/bi00067a022 8476861 \nCollinsracie LA  Mccolgan JM  Grant KL  Diblasiosmith EA  Mccoy JM  Lavallie ER   Production of recombinant bovine enterokinase catalytic subunit in Escherichia coli  using the novel secretory fusion partner Dsba Bio-Technol 1995 13 9 982 987 10.1038/nbt0995-982 \nCosta S  Almeida A  Castro A  Domingues L   Fusion tags for protein solubility, purification and immunogenicity in Escherichia coli: the novel Fh8 system Front Microbiol 2014 5 63 24600443 \nCreagh AL  Ong E  Jervis E  Kilburn DG  Haynes CA   Binding of the cellulose-binding domain of exoglucanase Cex from Cellulomonas fimi to insoluble microcrystalline cellulose is entropically driven Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1996 93 22 12229 12234 10.1073/pnas.93.22.12229 8901562 \nCreighton TE   How important is the molten globule for correct protein folding?

In spite of beneficial effects, non-judicious use of pesticides imposes harmful effect on human health as their residues reach different food materials and ground water via leaching, percolation and bioaccumulation. Looking into the potential of microbial degradation of toxic compounds under natural environment, a cypermethrin-degrading Bacillus sp. was isolated from pesticide-contaminated soil of a rice field of Distt. Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand, India. The bacteria degraded the compound up to 81.6 % within 15 days under standard growth conditions (temperature 32 °C pH 7 and shaking at 116 rpm) in minimal medium. Analysis of intermediate compounds of biodegraded cypermethrin revealed that the bacteria opted a new pathway for cypermethrin degradation. GC–MS analysis of biodegraded cypermethrin showed the presence of 4-propylbenzoate, 4-propylbenzaldehyde, phenol M-tert-butyl and 1-dodecanol, etc. which was not reported earlier in cypermethrin metabolism; hence a novel biodegradation pathway of cypermethrin with Bacillus sp. strain SG2 is proposed in this study.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-016-0372-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nBacillus sp.BiodegradationCypermethrinGC–MSPyrethroidissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nPyrethroid insecticides are synthetic derivatives of compounds of pyrethrin, produced by Chrysanthemum plants (Soderlund et al. 2002). These pesticides are widely used in agriculture, forestry, horticulture, public health and homes as well as for the protection of textiles and buildings (Lin et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2011). In agriculture, these pesticides are being used for more than 40 years (Narahashi et al. 1998; Shafer et al. 2005). Extensive use of these insecticides not only results in pest resistance but also leads to several environmental issues including human health (Li et al. 2008). Cypermethrin is mainly used in cereal and ornamental plants against coleopteran (Tribolium confusum), lepidepteran and other broad group of insect larva. This pesticide is also toxic for fish. Freshwater fish (Channa punctatus) exposed to cypermethrin show reduced resistance because of low levels of red blood cells and proteins in the blood (Saxena and Saxena 2010). High levels of this chemical are neurotoxic and cause ataxia, excessive salivation, choreoatheosis, tremors and convulsions in rabbits (Khanna et al. 2002). Cypermethrin affects the voltage-dependent sodium channel and ATPase system in neuronal membranes. It binds to nuclear DNA and leads to destabilization and unwinding of DNA (Patel et al. 2006).\n\nLooking into the facts of toxicity and persistency of this pesticide, it is urgently required to develop some strategies to eliminate or detoxify cypermethrin and its metabolites from the environment. Microbial diversity is the major factor in determining the fate of numerous xenobiotic/recalcitrant compounds in a contaminated environment. Biodegradation process involves the use of living microorganisms to detoxify or degrade the pollutants to less toxic forms. Till date, several bacterial strains such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Zhang et al. 2011), Streptomyces sp. (Lin et al. 2011), Stenotrophomonas sp. (Chen et al. 2011a) and Serratia marcescens (Cycoń et al. 2014a, b) have been reported to degrade pyrethroid pesticides. Many enzymes involved in biodegradation of cypermethrin and other pyrethroids are reported by Zhai et al. (2012) and Fan et al. (2012).In the present study, a Bacillus sp. (SG2) able to degrade cypermethrin was recovered from the pesticide-contaminated soil of a rice field of Tarai region of Uttarakhand. Biodegradation products of cypermethrin were analysed and possible biodegradation pathway of cypermethrin by Bacillus sp. (SG2) is proposed.\n\nMaterials and methods\nChemicals and media\nTechnical grade cypermethrin (95 % pure) was obtained from Department of Chemistry of the University and dissolved in acetonitrile to make a stock of 1 mg/ml. Stock solution was filter sterilized and kept in refrigerator for use. Minimal salt medium and nutrient broth (pH 7.0) were used for the isolation and cultivation of pesticide-degrading bacterial strains according to Negi et al. (2014). All the chemicals and solvents used in this study were of analytical grade.\n\nScreening and isolation of cypermethrin-degrading bacteria\nPesticide-contaminated soils were collected from a rice field of Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand, India. As per the result of residual analysis of the pesticide, the soil samples were used for the isolation of cypermethrin-degrading bacteria. One gramme soil was suspended in sterile distilled water. After dilution, one ml of soil suspension (10−5) was inoculated in nutrient agar plates. Bacterial colonies that appeared after 24 h on nutrient agar were enriched with cypermethrin by growing them successively in minimal medium. Discrete and pure bacterial colonies were transferred to 50 ml nutrient broth and incubated at 30 °C on an incubator shaker at 100 rpm. Cypermethrin-degrading bacterial cultures were screened from the isolated pure bacterial cultures by growing them in minimum salt agar plates supplemented with 50 ppm cypermethrin as described by Xu et al. (2008) and Negi et al. (2014). Selected bacteria (SG2) utilized cypermethrin as a carbon and energy source. Biodegradation studies of cypermethrin were monitored by analysing residual cypermethrin and its intermediates (after extraction) using a high-performance liquid chromatography system (HPLC–Dionex) at Department of Chemistry.\n\nIdentification of cypermethrin degrading bacterial strain\nMicrobiological and biochemical characterization of the cypermethrin-degrading bacterial strain (SG2) was performed according to Holt et al. (1994). For molecular characterization, genomic DNA of SG2 was extracted according to Bazzicalupo and Fani (1995). Amplification of 16S rDNA was done using Universal primers, 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′ and 5′-TACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′. PCR conditions used for the present study were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing temperature 55–51 °C (touchdown) followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 51 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with the last cycle followed by 10 min extension at 72 °C. After gel electrophoresis, PCR product was eluted using an extraction kit (Genei). After quantification, the sample was sent to Advanced Biotechnology Centre (CIF), Delhi University South Campus, India, for sequencing. Obtained sequences were compared with GenBank database using BLAST programme. Multiple sequence alignment for the homologous sequence was done by MEGA 5.0 software, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbour-joining method (Tamura et al. 2007).\n\nGrowth-linked biodegradation of cypermethrin in SG2\nIn vitro biodegradation of cypermethrin was performed in 100 ml flask with 50 ml minimal salt medium, supplemented with 50 ppm cypermethrin and inoculated with 1 ml SG2 culture before optimization the biodegradation conditions. Bacterial inoculum was prepared by inoculating single colony in 50 ml of MSM. Inoculated flask was incubated in an incubator shaker @ 100 rpm at 30 °C. Bacterial cells from the log phase, harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm for 10 min) and washed with minimal medium were used for the subsequent studies. Uninoculated medium acted as control. Bacterial growth was monitored by taking absorbance using UV–Visible spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer) and the residual cypermethrin concentration was measured by HPLC (Dionex), after extraction according to Anastassiades et al. (2003).\n\nOptimization of culture conditions for cypermethrin biodegradation\nResponse surface methodology (RSM) was explored to optimize the degradation conditions of cypermethrin using strain SG2. The Box-Behnken design with three replicates at the centre point was used to optimize the independent variables which significantly influenced cypermethrin biodegradation with Bacillus sp. according to Xiao et al. (2015). Three critical factors and their optimal ranges selected for biodegradation of cypermethrin in this experiment were temperature (28–38 °C), pH (4–8) and shaking (90–110 rpm) (Table 1). The dependent variable was degradation of 50 ppm cypermethrin in 50 ml of minimal medium at 15th day.Table 1 Box-Behnken design and the response of dependent variable in cypermethrin biodegradation\n\nRun\tX1\tX2\tX3\tPercent degradation by SG2\t\n1\t28\t5\t90\t71.4\t\n2\t36\t5\t90\t65.6\t\n3\t28\t9\t90\t77\t\n4\t36\t9\t90\t74.5\t\n5\t28\t5\t110\t65.7\t\n6\t36\t5\t110\t67.9\t\n7\t28\t9\t110\t74\t\n8\t36\t9\t110\t69.7\t\n9\t25.2\t7\t100\t69.8\t\n10\t38.7\t7\t100\t68.9\t\n11\t32\t3.6\t100\t64.8\t\n12\t32\t10.3\t100\t61.2\t\n13\t32\t7\t83.1\t76.5\t\n14\t32\t7\t116.8\t81.6\t\n15\t32\t7\t100\t80\t\n16\t32\t7\t100\t74.7\t\n17\t32\t7\t100\t74\t\n18\t32\t7\t100\t73\t\n19\t32\t7\t100\t72\t\n20\t32\t7\t100\t77\t\nThe data are means of three replicates\n\n\nX1 temperature, (25, 28, 32, 36 and 38 °C); X2 medium pH, (3.6, 5, 7, 9, 10); X3 Shaking speed in rpm, (83.1, 90, 100, 110, 116.8)\n\n\n\nFT-IR analysis of cypermethrin biodegradation\nAn in vitro pesticide biodegradation study was conducted in 50 ml minimal salt medium, inoculated with1 ml of 24-h-old bacterial culture and supplemented with cypermethrin (50 ppm). Uninoculated flasks spiked with same concentration of cypermethrin acted as control. Experiment was conducted in triplicate. Intermediate compounds of cypermethrin were extracted in acetonitrile after 15 days according to Negi et al. (2014). Samples were analysed by FT-IR at Department of Biophysics to locate the bond stretching in the test pesticide after biodegradation.\n\nGC–MS analysis of cypermethrin biodegradation\nTo check the degradation of cypermethrin in soil slurry, 50 g autoclaved soil was taken in a 100-ml flask, to which 20 ml of minimal medium was added. Cypermethrin (100 ppm) was added to all the sets, to which 1 ml of 24-h-old bacterial culture was added and mixed properly. One ml of soil slurry was taken from all the flasks separately on 0, 10 and 15th day after incubation. Uninoculated flasks spiked with pesticides acted as control. Extraction and quantification of cypermethrin was done by HPLC. For GC–MS analysis, samples were extracted from soil slurry and metabolites of biodegraded cypermethrin were identified at AIRF facility, JNU, New Delhi.\n\nChemical analysis\nResidual analysis of cypermethrin in collected soil samples was performed according to Anastassiades et al. (2003). Residual pesticide was extracted by adding either 5 ml of culture broth or 5 g of soil to 20 ml of acetone in a flask. The mixture was filtered using Buchner funnel after shaking for 1 h and the obtained residue was filtered again after washing thoroughly with 10 ml acetone. Filtrate was collected in a round-bottom flask. The residual analysis of the pesticide was done using HPLC attached with C18 reverse-phase column and UV detector. A mixture of acetonitrile and water (70:30, v/v) was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 with the injection volume of 10 μL.\n\nResults\nIsolation and characterization of cypermethrin-degrading bacteria\nIn the present study, a bacterial isolate (SG2), able to utilize cypermethrin as a carbon source, was isolated from the pesticide-contaminated soil of a rice field of Udham Singh Nagar Uttarakhand, India. Bacterial colonies, growing on nutrient agar plates, were rough, opaque and dirty white.The organism was aerobic, gram-positive, rod-shaped and showed positive tests for the production of Indole -3 acetic acid and siderophore and phosphate solubilisation. The bacteria utilized dextrose and mannitol as carbon source and degraded 80 % of cypermethrin (50 ppm) within 15 days under shaking conditions in minimal medium. Analysis of the 16S rDNA gene sequences demonstrated that SG2 belonged to Bacillus sp. \nThe organism was provided an accession number (KR108289) by NCBI data base (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Phylogenetic analysis of SG2 strain and related strains on the basis of 16S rDNA using MEGA 5.0 software. The numbers in parentheses represent the sequence accession number in Genbank. Bar represents sequence divergence\n\n\n\nUtilization of cypermethrin by strain SG2\nThe isolate, Bacillus sp. (SG2), was able to grow on MSM agar plates supplemented with 110–170 ppm cypermethrin. Degradation rate of cypermethrin increased gradually as the strain entered the logarithmic phase (4–5 days) followed by stationary phase (7–8 days) (Fig. 2). A decline in degradation rate was observed when the strain attained the death phase (12 days). More than 81 % of cypermethrin (50 ppm) was degraded by strain SG2 within 15 days in comparison to control.Fig. 2 Utilization of cypermethrin by strain SG2 (filled circle) growth of SG2, (filled square) utilization kinetics of cypermethrin, (filled triangle) Control\n\n\n\nOptimization of cypermethrin degradation\nBox-Behnken design was used to determine the effect of three important variables [temperature (X1), pH (X2) and shaking speed (X3)] on the biodegradation of cypermethrin by Bacillus sp. (SG2). The experimental design and the response of dependent variables for cypermethrin are presented in Table 1. Data from Table 1 were processed by response surface regression procedure of Design Expert 6.0.10 software, and results were obtained by fitting the values in the quadratic model equation: Response (Y)=+80.21-0.63X1+0.85X2+0.32X3-3.53X12-6.17X22-0.49X32+0.47X1X2-0.10X1X3+0.32X2X3 where (Y) is the predicted cypermethrin degradation (%) by strain SG2 and X1, X2 and X3 are the values for temperature, pH and shaking speed, respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for cypermethrin degradation is presented in Table 2. Determination coefficient R2 = 0.8863 indicated that approximately 88 % of responses were covered by the model, demonstrating that predicted values of the model were in good agreement with the experimental values. The model for cypermethrin biodegradation is highly significant (p < 0.0001), indicating that the established quadratic model for cypermethrin degradation by SG2 was adequate and reliable and represented actual relationship between response and variables (Fig. 3).Table 2 ANOVA for the fitted quadratic model for cypermethrin biodegradation\n\nSource\tSS\t\nDF\n\tMS\tF value\t\nP level\t\nModel\t694.1558\t9\t77.12842\t8.656952\t0.0012\t\nX1\t5.432684\t1\t5.432684\t0.609769\t0.4530\t\nX2\t9.760639\t1\t9.760639\t1.095541\t0.3199\t\nX3\t1.402913\t1\t1.402913\t0.157464\t0.6998\t\nX1X1\t180.0615\t1\t180.0615\t20.21024\t0.0012\t\nX2X2\t548.3952\t1\t548.3952\t61.55229\t<0.0001\t\nX3X3\t3.519622\t1\t3.519622\t0.395045\t0.5437\t\nX1X2\t1.805\t1\t1.805\t0.202595\t0.6622\t\nX1X3\t0.08\t1\t0.08\t0.008979\t0.9264\t\nX2X3\t0.845\t1\t0.845\t0.094843\t0.7644\t\nResidual\t89.0942\t10\t8.90942\t\t\t\nLack of fit\t85.8942\t5\t17.17884\t26.84194\t0.0013\t\nPure error\t3.2\t5\t0.64\t\t\t\nCor total\t783.25\t19\t\t\t\t\n\nR\n2 = 0.8863, CV = 4.07\n\n\nDF degrees of freedom, SS sum of sequences, MS mean square\n\n* P level <0.05 indicates that the model terms are significant\n\nFig. 3 Response surface plot showing effect of temperature, pH and shaking speed on cypermethrin biodegradation (where A temperature, B pH, C shaking speed)\n\n\n\nFT-IR analysis of biodegraded cypermethrin\nDegradation of cypermethrin in soil slurry was maximum as compared to minimal broth (data not shown). Cypermethrin degradation in mimimal media and in soil slurry was 81.6 and 89 %, respectively, after 15 days with SG2. FTIR studies were conducted to identify the changes in bonding/streching and vibrations in biodegraded cypermethrin. Five major peaks were present at 1376, 1458, 2857.7, 2924.9, 2958.6 cm−1 in control. Significant changes in peak pattern of cypermethrin under bacterial treatment as compared to control were observed (Fig. 4a, b). Absorbance of the bands, associated with ether-cyanate and ester group was 1376 and 1100 cm−1, respectively. A decrease in cypermethrin carbonyl band (1740 cm−1) and a slight increase in carbonyl signals (around 1650–1700 and 1760–1780 cm−1) were observed due to carbonyl stretching. Stretching in C=C chloroalkenes, ring vibration of benzene, CH2 deformation in R–CH2–CN structure and (C=O)–O–stretching in cypermethrin were reported by Kaur et al. (2015) using Fusarium sp. In the present study, FTIR spectra of biodegraded cypermethrin showed major changes in the range of 1000–1650 and 2259–3431 cm−1, indicating degradation of cypermethrin. Similarly, Rosenheimer and Dubowski (2008) performed photolysis of thin films of cypermethrin using in situ FTIR monitoring. Identified photoproducts were 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde, 3- phenoxybenzoic acid, acetonitrile and cypermethrin isomers (Rosenheimer et al. 2011).Fig. 4 FT-IR spectra of cypermethrin. a Cypermethrin control. b Cpermethrin treated with SG2\n\n\n\nGC–MS analysis of cypermethrin metabolites\nPeaks of two compounds, GC1 (4.123 min) and GC2 (4.125 min), appeared first during the cypermethrin biodegradation by SG2. These compounds were identified as phenol and 4-hydroxybenzoate, respectively, based on their retention time and molecular weight with those of corresponding authentic compounds in the database. Peaks of GC3 (8.348 min) and GC4 (8.587 min) were observed and the corresponding compounds were 4-propylbenzaldehyde and phenol, M-tert-butyl as per the database. Similarly some other metabolites were also identified as they showed different retention time (Table 3). Based on the identity of the metabolites, biodegradation pathway of cypermethrin in strain SG2 was proposed and presented in \nFig. 5. Cypermethrin was initially metabolized by the hydrolysis of ester linkage which yielded 3-(2, 2-dichloro ethenyl)—2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylate [GC15] and α-hydroxy-3-phenoxybenzeneacetonitrile [GC7]. Compound GC7 was unstable in the environment and oxidized to form 3- phenoxybenzaldehyde [GC8]. Subsequent oxidation of GC8 resulted in the formation of 4-propylbenzaldehyde [GC3]. \nCompound GC3 could be further transformed to 4-hydroxybenzoate [GC2], which could be converted into phenyl ester of o-phenoxy benzoic acid (GC13). Subsequently, GC13 transformed into M-tert-butyl phenol (GC4), which can further be converted to 2-tert-pentylphenol (GC5). It is possible that GC1 and GC5 transformed into small molecular weight aliphatic compounds, i.e. 1-dodecanol (GC6), isopropyl myristate (GC9) and oleic acid (GC11) and may lead to complete mineralization of cypermethrin thereafter.Fig. 5 GC-MS spectra of the cypermethrin with strain SG2\n\nTable 3 Identification of intermediate metabolites of cypermethrin by GC–MS\n\nIntermediate metabolites with their code number\tRetention time (min)\tMolecular weight (MW)\tIntermediate metabolites\t\nGC1\t4.123\t94\tPhenol\t\nGC2\t4.125\t138\t4-Hydroxybenzoate\t\nGC3\t8.348\t148\t4-Propylbenzaldehyde\t\nGC4\t8.587\t150\tPhenol, M-tert-butyl-\t\nGC5\t9.514\t164\t2-Tert-pentylphenol\t\nGC6\t10.908\t186\t1-Dodecanol\t\nGC7\t13.725\t225\t\nα-Hydroxy-3- phenoxy- benzeneacetonitrile\t\nGC8\t13.728\t198\t3-Phenoxy-benzaldehyde,\t\nGC9\t14.906\t270\tIsopropyl myristate\t\nGC10\t15.944\t298\tHexadecanoic acid, methyl ester\t\nGC11\t18.052\t282\tOleic Acid\t\nGC12\t18.917\t270\tIsoamyl laurate\t\nGC13\t23.700\t256\tPhenyl ester of o-phenoxy benzoic acid\t\nGC14\t23.958\t415\tCypermethrin\t\nGC15\t24.100\t236\t3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylate\t\n\n\nDiscussion\nNumerous studies have shown the isolation and characterization of pesticide degrading bacteria from pesticide-contaminated soil, groundwater and activated sludge (Tallur et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2011b; Negi et al. 2014). Bacillus sp. is widely existing in nature and safely used in a variety of food products because of its nontoxicogenic and non pathogenic properties, identified by Food and Drug Administration (Gong et al. 2014; Xiao et al. 2015). Bacillus sp. is also reported to degrade a number of xenobiotic compounds including 4-chloro-2 nitrophenol, red M5B dye, dimethylformamide and methyl parathion (Arora 2012; Gunasekar et al. 2013). Current study provides the evidence of efficient degradation pathway of cypermethrin by Bacillus sp. Strain SG2. The bacteria converted cypermetrin into smaller molecular weight compounds which can further be mineralized under natural environmental conditions.\n\nBiodegradation of cypermethrin increased with increased bacterial growth in minimal medium. Our observations are relevant with the findings of Singh et al. (2004) and Xiao et al. (2015). Strain SG2 could utilize cypermethrin as a sole carbon source and degraded it over a wide range of temperature (28–38 °C), pH (4–8) and shaking speed (90–110). The presence of longer exponential phase in the bacterial growth curve at initial higher cypermethrin concentration could be related to higher bacterial population requirement for pesticide degradation. It is proposed that higher initial bacterial counts were needed to initiate rapid degradation of the pesticide (Xiao et al. 2015). Bacillus sp. strain SG2 needed a longer lag phase to adapt to a new environment which induced the synthesis of degradative enzymes (Dubey and Fulekar 2013). The degradative enzymes do not show much substrate specificity, so one strain of Bacillus sp. can grow and degrade many hazardous substances. Strain SG2 could degrade all the pyrethroids because all the pyrethroid insecticides share a similar structure as reported by Wang et al. (2011).\n\nThe purpose to use RSM in the present study was to optimize the best culture conditions for maximum biodegradation of cypermethrin. RSM is the evaluation of relationships between the predicted values of the dependent variable and the conditions of dependent variables (Hosseini-Parvar et al. 2009). Box-Behnken design, as used commonly in industrial applications because of its economical design, requires only three levels of each factor. Chen et al. (2011b) and Xiao et al. (2015) have used RSM, based on the Box-Behnken design to optimize the degradation condition of pyrethroid insecticides at different temperature, pH and inoculum size. They described that RSM is convenient and efficient system to investigate the optimum degradation conditions for pyrethroid insecticides by different microorganisms. In our study a statistical model based on RSM was applied to optimize the cypermethrin degradation conditions by strain SG2. The model was proved to be reliable and accurate within the limit of chosen factors.\n\nAs a strategy to develop efficient biodegradation conditions, it is important to analyse the metabolic pathway of the test compound. Most of the pyrethroid insecticides produce more toxic intermediates in biodegradation processes (Laffin et al. 2010). Our results showed that the strain SG2 was not only efficiently able to degrade cypermethrin but also transformed the metabolites (compound GC1-GC15) into non toxic forms. Our results are in accordance to the reports of Zhang et al. (2011). It is presumed that ester hydrolysis of pyrethroid takes place by carboxylesterases. This enzyme acts as a regulatory enzyme for pyrethroid degradation and results in acid and alcohol production (Zhang et al. 2010; Xiao et al. 2015). Metabolites of biodegraded cypermethrin in soil slurry were extracted and identified by GC–MS (Table 3). Each peak was identified on the basis of its characteristic m/z fragment ions and matched with authentic compounds available in the database. Chromatogram of GC–MS for cypermethrin degradation by strain SG2 is shown in Fig. 6. Cypermethrin disappeared concomitantly with the formation of new metabolites. In the present study, cypermethrin was metabolized to several intermediate compounds which were further transformed into non- toxic and environmentally accepted forms. By arranging the metabolites into their location in the pathway we have proposed the hypothetical degradation pathway of cypermethrin using strain SG2. Maximum degradation of cypermethrin was observed in soil slurry; hence intermediate compounds of biodegraded cypermethrin were extracted from soil slurry after 15 days. Cypermethrin could be metabolised into two major compounds (α-hydroxy-3-phenoxy- benzene acetonitrile and 3-(2, 2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylate). α-hydroxy-3- phenoxy- benzene acetonitrile is unstable and spontaneously transformed to yield 3-phenoxy benzaldehyde (Chen et al. 2011b; Lin et al. 2011; Xiao et al. 2015). 3- phenoxybenzaldehyde has antimicrobial activity, but does not affect producing culture and enhances biodegradation in soil or media (Chen et al. 2011b). 3- phenoxybenzaldehyde is transformed into 4-propylbenzaldehyde which again converts to 4-hydroxybenzoate. Afterward 4-hydroxybenzoate was metabolized by strain SG2 to form phenyl ester of o-phenoxy benzoic acid. Two intermediate metabolites (3-phenoxybenzoic acid and 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde) are the key metabolites of pyrethroids (Laffin et al. 2010). Chen et al. (2011c) reported the degradation of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid by Stenotrophomonas sp. strain ZS-S-01. A Pseudomonas sp. was also able to utilise β-cypermethrin (Halden et al. 1999). In the present study, metabolites of 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde degradation were also reported. Strain SG2 was also able to use 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde. These results demonstrate that Bacillus sp. strain SG2 possesses the metabolic pathway for the complete detoxification of cypermethrin, indicating that strain SG2 may be an ideal microorganism for bioremediation of the cypermethrin in contaminated soil or water system.Fig. 6 Proposed pathway of Cypermethrin degradation with SG2 strain\n\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOCX 434 kb)\n\n \n\nFinancial support by Ministry of Environment and Forestry, New Delhi, India, is duly acknowledged.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nAuthor declares no conflict of interest.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAnastassiades M  Lehotay SJ  Stajnbaher D  Schenck FJ   Fast and easy multi residue method employing extraction/partitioning and dispersive solid phase extraction for the determination of pesticide residues in produce J AOAC Int 2003 86 412 431 12723926 \nArora PK   Decolourization of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol by a soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis  RKJ 700 PLoS One 2012 7 e52012 10.1371/journal.pone.0052012 23251673 \nBazzicalupo M  Fani R   Clap JP   The use of RAPD for generating specific DNA probes for microorganisms Methods in molecular biology.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacers of the ribosomal DNA showed a high diversity among the 51 fungal isolates collection. Representatives of 25 genera and 29 species were identified, most of which were members of one of the following phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota). In addition to the phylogenetic diversity, a high diversity of secreted enzyme profiles was also detected among the fungal isolates. All fungal strains produced at least one of the following enzymes: laccase, cellulase, protease and/or lipase.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-015-0356-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nIsolationWood degrading fungiEnzyme activitiesLaccaseBiotechnological applicationissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nWood is the most abundant biopolymer in nature and is made up mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The lignin polymer is highly recalcitrant toward chemical and biological degradation due to its molecular architecture, where different non-phenolic phenylpropanoid units forming a complex three-dimensional network, are interconnected by a variety of ether and carbon–carbon bonds. Its biodegradation is a key step for carbon recycling in terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nA number of. microorganisms including bacteria and filamentous fungi are able to degrade lignocellulosic components to various extents (Eriksson et al. 1990; Ruiz-Dueñas and Martínez 2009). Fungi participating in plant cell wall deconstruction include white rot, brown rot and leaf litter fungi (Cho et al. 2009).\n\nThe white rot fungi are the most studied because they are the unique organisms able to mineralize cell wall components with high lignin content, producing a bleached aspect of decayed wood in nature (Taylor 1995; Sigoillot et al. 2012). This ability is related to their production of a nonspecific system, including several extracellular enzymes, low molecular weight metabolites and activated oxygen species (Schoemarker 1990; Dashtban et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2012). It is worth mentioning that this system is also involved in the degradation of aromatic recalcitrant compounds causing environmental problems (Schoemarker et al. 1991; Reddy 1995).\n\nIn this sense, ligninolytic enzymes have been involved in the degradation of xenobiotic and recalcitrant aromatic compounds, industrial dyes (Khlifi et al. 2009; Daâssi et al. 2012), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Lee et al. 2013), pesticides (Xiao et al. 2011), dioxins (Sato et al. 2002), chlorophenols (Li et al. 2011), explosives (Cheong et al. 2006) and kraft pulp bleaching (Moldes et al. 2010).\n\nThe enzymes involved in lignin degradation include laccases, different types of peroxidases and oxidases producing H2O2 (Shimada and Higuchi 1991, Martínez et al. 2009). The most widely studied ligninolytic enzymes are, lignin peroxidase (LiP), Mn-dependent peroxidase (MnP) and laccase (Lac) (Thurston 1994; Orth and Tien 1995) in contrast to the other high redox potential peroxidases, such as versatile peroxidase (VP) and dye decolorizing peroxidase (DyP, EC 1.11.1.19) (Martínez et al. 2009; Sugano 2009). The complete conversion of lignocellulose requires the hydrolysis of structural cell wall polysaccharides by carbohydrate-acting enzymes, such as cellulases and hemicellulases (Hatakka and Hammel 2010). In addition other complementary enzymes, such as esterases/lipases or proteases, could complement the enzymatic cocktails to completely transform wood biomass into product of biotechnological interest, such as animal feed, chemical products and/or biofuel (Leonowicz et al. 1999; Barriuso et al. 2013; Dashtban et al. 2010).\n\nAlthough basidiomycetes have been the most commonly studied fungi as principal organisms involved in lignin biodegradation, Ascomycetes are also able to degrade cellulose and hemicellulose despite their limitation in lignin conversion (Martínez et al. 2005). Among these ascomycetes some pathogenic fungi, such as Fusarium solani, are able to degrade lignin and secrete laccases and lignin peroxidases (Obruca et al. 2012).\n\nIt is estimated that there are approximately 1.5 million fungal species in the world, of which only approximately 4.6 % are described (Hawksworth, 2001). Given the wide diversity of the ligninolytic enzymes, the lignocellulosic degrading enzyme complex to which they belong and their dependence on the species and/or on the culture conditions (Hatakka, 1994; Peláez et al. 1995), the isolation and study of new ligninolytic fungi and their enzymes still receive huge interest for their putative biotechnological applications.\n\nIn this study, within the framework of a screening program of lignin microorganism degraders, we aimed to assess the fungal diversity of wood degraders in Tunisian forests. 51 new fungal species were isolated, identified, phylogenetically grouped and analyzed for their enzymes involved in biomass transformation (laccase, lipase, cellulase and protease activities).\n\nMaterials and methods\nChemicals\n2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) (cas: 30931-67-0), guaiacol (cas: 90-05-1) and the dyes: reactive black 5 (RB-5), Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) (cas: 2580-78-1) and Blue Turquoise (GL) (cas: 1330-38-7) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Tunis, Tunisia).\n\nCollection of fungi\nPieces of decaying wood were collected from different habitats of the Northwest region of Tunisia (forests of Ain Draham, Bousalem and Kef) during the winters of (2009–2010) and 2011 to isolate wood-degrading fungal strains. Samples were transported in sterilized plastic bags and brought to the laboratory without further exposure to the external environment. The samples were marked with relevant information, such as number, location, and specific characteristics.\n\nIsolation of fungal strains\nFungal strains were isolated using a selective agar media composed of Malt Extract (ME) (30 g/L, pH 5.5) supplemented with antibiotics (ampicillin and streptomycin at 0.01 %) to avoid bacterial growth (Kiiskinen et al. 2002). The samples were surface sterilized by drying under a laminar flow hood and squares of approximately 3 × 3 mm were placed on selective agar media. The plates were subsequently incubated at 30 °C. Later on, when the mycelium had grown on the solid media, the samples were transferred to fresh agar media in Petri-dishes. This was repeated until pure cultures could be obtained as single cultures or so-called fungal isolates. Qualitative screening method for enzyme production was carried out by inoculation of 1 cm diameter pieces of mycelium from each strain onto the specific medium for the given enzyme activity.\n\nEnzyme activity detection in solid media\nEnzymatic activities were analyzed in plates and the fungal isolates classified as positive or negative, correlated with the presence or the absence of the halo surrounding mycelium growth. To determine the activity of each isolated strain, inoculations were made in triplicate, taking a fraction (approx. 0.5 cm2) of the mycelium under aseptic conditions and placing it in the center of the plate containing the corresponding medium for the enzymatic activity analyzed. Then, they were incubated at 30 °C until the activity recorded.\n\nDetection of protease activity\nThe proteolytic activity of fungal isolates was tested on a milk nutrient agar medium. The medium contained 3 and 5 g/L yeast extract and peptone, respectively. The pH was then adjusted to 5.5 and the medium supplemented with 15 g/L agar.\n\nAfter sterilization, 250 mL of sterile milk were added to the medium. After mixing the medium was poured into Petri dishes. The activity was determined by measuring the halo formed by the degraded milk proteins (Mayerhofer et al. 1973).\n\nDetection of CMCase activity\nCellulolytic activity was detected on agar plates supplemented with 1 g/L of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The screening medium contained (g/L): yeast extract (1.0), K2HPO4 (2.0), KH2PO4 (1.0), MgSO4 (1.0) MnSO4 (0.4), FeSO4 (0.01) and (NH4)2SO4 (3.0). The pH of the medium was then adjusted to 5.5. The plates were incubated at 30 °C and after growth, they were washed with Congo red and distained with 1 M NaCl. In positive samples a hydrolyzed zone appears transparent while the non hydrolyzed regions appeared bright red. The presence of a clear zone around the isolate demonstrated that the tested isolate produced cellulolytic enzymes (Sakthivel et al. 2010).\n\nDetection of lipolytic activity\nRhodamine B and olive oil agar plates (ME (30 g/L), 1 % olive oil, 0.001 % rhodamine B (Sigma, Tunis, Tunisia), and 1.5 % agar (Difco, Tunis, Tunisia) were used for the detection of lipase activity. After 7 days of incubation at 30 °C, the culture plates were revealed under 365 nm light and the activity was determined by visual evaluation of fluorescence intensity (Kouker and Jaeger 1987).\n\nDetection of amylase activity\nThe screening procedure for amylase activity detection was based on a plate culture method which uses soluble starch (1 %) as carbon source. The screening plate medium contained (g/L): yeast extract (1.0), K2HPO4 (2.0), KH2PO4 (1.0), MgSO4 (1.0) MnSO4 (0.4), FeSO4 (0.01) and (NH4)2SO4 (3.0). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.5 by using 12 N HCl. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 20 min. Fungi were placed on the agar medium and incubated at 30 °C for 7 days. Starch degrading fungi were identified based of the formation of clear zones after exposure with Lugol’s iodine solution (1 % iodine; 2 % potassium iodide w/v). Diameters of clear zones and fungal colonies were evaluated by a millimeter ruler (Singh and Modi 2013).\n\nDetection of laccase and ligninase activities\nPrimary screening: culture on solid media\nTo assess laccase activity, ME medium (30 g/L, 18 g/L agar) containing 4 mM guaiacol or 2 mM ABTS (2,2′-azino-di-3-ethylbenzotiazol-6-sulfonate acid) supplemented with 0.15 mM CuSO4 was used. Incubation of plates was performed at 30 °C. Positive laccase activity was identified by the formation of reddish brown halo in guaiacol and greenish-colored halo in ABTS supplemented plates. Observations were carried out by measuring the diameter of ring-shaped mycelia (Gnanasalomi and Gnanadoss 2013). The diameter of the halo indicated the level of laccase activity produced.\n\nLigninase activity was assayed based on the decolorization of different families of textile dyes such as remazol brilliant blue (RBBR), reactive black 5 (RB5) and turquoise blue (GL) (phthalocyanine). ME medium (30, 18 g/L agar) containing 150 mg/L of dye was used. Decolorization in a solid medium was assessed by visual disappearance of color from the plate (Selvam et al. 2012; Zouari-Mechichi et al. 2006).\n\nSecondary screening: cultures on liquid media\nThe quantitative determination of laccase activity, ABTS and guaiacol oxidizing strains were grown in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL M7 medium. Each flask was inoculated with three cylindrical plugs (4 mm in diameter) of active mycelia from previously cultured in ME agar and incubated at 30 °C, 150 rpm for 20 days. Sampling was done at regular intervals and centrifuged at 8000 rpm, +4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were used to measure laccase activities. All the experiment was carried out in duplicates.\n\nLaccase activity assay\nSpectrophotometric assays of laccase activity were carried out with 1 mM guaiacol or 10 mM 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulphonate) (ABTS) as substrates, in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). When guaiacol was used, the absorbance was monitored at 465 nm (ε = 12,000 M−1 cm−1); when ABTS was the substrate, the absorbance was monitored at 436 nm (ε = 29,300 M−1 cm−1) (Silva et al. 2005).\n\nIdentification of fungal isolates by sequencing the ITS region\nEach isolate was cultivated in a 100 mL flask containing 25 mL of liquid ME medium for 5 days. Then mycelium was collected, washed with sterile Milli-Q water and lyophilized.\n\nThe molecular identification was carried out with the protocol presented by Daâssi et al. (2013). The primers used for the amplification were ITS1 (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) (White et al., 1990). Sequencing was performed using an automated ABI Prism 3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Tunis, Tunisia).\n\nDNA sequence and phylogenetic analysis\nThe resulting sequences were subjected to BlastN analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BlastN). The organisms were identified relying on the sequences available in the database presenting the highest homology. The sequences from the different isolated strains and those from the GenBank were aligned using CLUSTAL W (Thompson et al. 1994). Distances were calculated and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987). Bootstrap analysis was done based on 1000 replicates. The MEGA3 package was used for all analyses. Sequences have been deposited in GenBank. Genbank accession numbers will be provided later.\n\nResults and discussion\nIsolation and identification of fungi isolated from Tunisian forests\nThe isolation experiments resulted in fifty-one fungal isolates. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of fungal rDNA have been successfully used for species identification (Table 1). The fungal strains isolated during this work were found to be highly diverse based on the ITS genetic marker (Table 2). The capacity of the isolates to produce laccases, lipases, proteases, amylases, and cellulolytic enzymes was investigated on selective solid media (Table 3).Table 1 Blast report showing the accession

isolates to the genus or even the species level according to Rossello Mora and Amman (2001) except few isolates such as isolate CLBE 24 that matched an undescribed uncultured fungus. The 51 fungal isolates belong to 22 genera and 34 species (Table 2). Ascomycete fungi of the genera: Phoma (single strain), Ilyonectria (1 strain), Coniochaeta (3 strains), Neurospora (1 strain), Trichoderma (7 strains), Spencermartinsia (1 strain), Fusarium (6 strains), Alternaria (4 strains), Thermomyces (6 strains), Preussia (1 strain), Cladosporium (1 strain), Paecilomyces (1 strain), and Pyronellaea (1 strain), basidiomycetes of the genera: Trametes (1 strain), Coriolopsis (4 strains), Phanerochaete (3 strains), Ganoderma (1 strain), Bjerkandera (2 strains), Gloeophyllum (2 strains), Prosterium (1 strain) and Perenniporia (1 strain) and Mucoromycetes of the genus Mucor (1 strain), were identified and studied in detail.\n\nSecreted enzymatic activities\nAll 51 isolates were screened by plate test methods for laccases, proteases, amylases, cellulases, and lipases production. Data presented in Table 3 shows that among the tested isolates, 32 strains were found to produce laccases, 25 strains were found to produce cellulases, 18 strains were found to produce amylases, 21 strains were found to produce proteases and 27 strains were found to produce lipases. Therefore, the results of enzymes screening (Table 3) show a high diversity of enzymatic activities in the fungi isolated from Tunisian forests. Several studies reported that ligninolytic fungi use a combination of several activities (hydrolases, oxidoreductases and esterases) for wood degradation indicating the complexity of the ligninocellulosic materials (Yoon et al. 2007; Ljungdahl 2008; Dashtban et al. 2010).\n\nProtease activity producing fungi\nTable 3, clearly shows that protease activity is revealed principally in basidiomycete taxa, including fungi from Trametes, Ganoderma and Phanerochaete genera although ascomycete fungi, from Ilyonectria genus, were able to produce this activity. While, the presence of extracellular proteases in basidiomycete fungi, such as Coriolopsis trogii (Caporale et al. 1996) and Trametes versicolor (Staszczak and Nowak, 1984), has been well known for decades, their occurrence in Phanerochaete chrysosporium is a current topic of interest (Dass et al. 1995; Xiong et al. 2008). These authors investigated the effect of nitrogen excess/limitation culture conditions on the expression of proteases and peroxidases in P. chrysosporium. They reported that the wood-degrading fungus P. chrysosporium produces proteolytic activity associated to excess nitrogen conditions (non-ligninolytic conditions). However, when subjected to nitrogen limitation, Phanerochaete produces principally peroxidases to depolymerize lignin in wood. These studies provide clues to optimize extracellular enzymes production by fungi in synthetic media for biotechnological applications.\n\nLipase activity producing fungi\n\nLipolytic activity has been studied in the isolates collection. The results (Table 3) reveal a relevant capacity of the tested fungi to secrete lipase, making their further study very interesting. Among the tested strains, 27 lipase-producing fungi were detected within ascomycete group, such as Thermomyces, Fusarium and Neonectria. In Fusarium and Thermomyces the capacity to synthesize this type of enzymes is well characterized (Jallouli et al. 2012; Kovalenko et al. 2013). Our Results also agree with those of Cruz-Ramírez et al. (2012), where 49 lipase producing fungi have been recovered from a screening of fungal isolates from decaying wood samples collected in Mexico.\n\nCellulase producing fungi\nTable 3 shows that among the 51 decay-wood fungi isolates, 25 strains present degradation halos reflecting a good activity on carboxymethylcellulose (CMCase) activity, indicating that this fungus is able to secrete a high β-1,4-endoglucanase activity. It is well known that fungal lignin degradation involves lignocellulolytic enzymes such as CMCases to degrade lignocellulosic components in wood. CMCases are important enzymes necessary for the degradation of cellulose and have been reported from well-known strains of Trichoderma and Paecilomyces (Colussi et al. 2011; Hussain et al. 2012). The ability of these fungal strains to degrade lignocellulosic biomass, as well as their utility in treatments of pulp and paper mill effluent, have been mentioned in many reports (Hussain et al. 2012). In addition to CMCase other cellulolytic enzymes such as cellobiohydrolases were shown to be also secreted simultaneously in Trichoderma harzianum IOC 3844 (de Castro et al. 2010; Colussi et al. 2011) and Paecilomyces variotii 103-7 isolated from naturally degraded wood (Hussain et al. 2012).\n\nAmylase producing fungi\nAmylase activity was detected in some members of the fungal collection and was present in 35 % of the total isolates. P. variotii and Neurospora sp. were good producers of amylases (Table 3). In the same trend, Michelin et al. (2010) reported the purification of a thermostable α-amylase produced by the fungus P. variotti.\n\nLaccase producing fungi\nWood decay fungi are a very good source of lignin enzymes typically phenol oxidases (laccases). Data presented in Table 3 show that of the 51 tested strains, 31 exhibited significant guaiacol-oxidation activity expressed within the first week of incubation. Most of basidiomycetes were able to produce laccase and among them representatives of the genera Trametes, Phanerochaete, Ganoderma, Bjerkandera, and Porostereum were ranked as the best producers (Table 3). The basidiomycetous white-rot fungi are the most efficient lignin-degrading organisms in nature (Fackler et al. 2006).\n\nPrimary screening: culture on solid media\nFungi showing guaiacol-oxidation activities in Table 3 were cultivated on solid media containing 4 mM guaiacol or 2 mM ABTS in the presence of 150 mM CuSO4 that enabled the detection of laccases as specific color reactions (Machado et al. 2005). Guaiacol and ABTS were considered as the best substrates for laccase activity (Thurston 1994).\n\nThe positive strains showed reddish brown halo in guaiacol supplemented agar and dark-green halo in ABTS supplemented plates (Fig. 1a). The diameter of the halo and the color intensity indicating a positive extracellular oxidoreductase secretion from mycelium was used to screen the level of laccase production of each strain (Table 4).Fig. 1 Photo of ME agar plate showing positive guaiacol, ABTS (a) and dyes (b) (GL, RB-5 and RBBR) oxidation by fungal isolates obtained from decayed wood samples after 7 days of inoculation\n\nTable 4 Qualitative test for Lac+ isolates using colored indicators (4 mM of guaiacol and 2 mM of ABTS) and quantitative test in liquid M7 medium (with their 95 % confidence limits; Mean ± standard deviation (n = 3); 30 °C; 150 rpm, in the presence of 150 mM CuSO4)\n\nNo.\tStrains\tQualitative test\tQuantitative test\t\nReddish-brown zone formation (guaiacol)\tGreen halo zone formation (ABTS)\tLac activity (U/L) with guaiacol\tLac activity (U/L) with ABTS\t\n1\tBS54\t+++\t++\t3880 ± 12.2 (9 day)\t4761 ± 5.3 (9 day)\t\n2\tBS2\t++ \t+++\tND\t–\t\n3\tBS22\t++ \t+++\t1256 ± 6.4 (9 day)\t1443 ± 3.5 (9 day)\t\n4\tTM11\t+++\t++\t4545 ± 8.2 (9 day)\t4914 ± 4.7 (9 day)\t\n5\tBS17\t+\t+\t–\t–\t\n6\tBS34\t+++\t++\t1556 ± 6.1 (6 day)\t1788 ± 7.2 (6 day)\t\n7\tD6\t+\t+\t94 ± 3.1 (4 day)\t123 ± 1.9 (4 day)\t\n8\tBS14\t+\t+\t864 ± 9.2 (5 day)\t1127 ± 6.8 (5 day)\t\n9\tBS19\t+++\t+\t122 ± 3.6 (9 day)\t165 ± 1.9 (9 day)\t\n10\t11B\t+++\t+++\t8358 ± 14.7 (12 day)\t11,134 ± 10.3 (12 day)\t\n11\tA3\t++\t+++\t5233 ± 6.5 (8 day)\t7064 ± 9.1 (8 day)\t\n12\tAD40\t++\t+++\t4276 ± 11.4 (8 day)\t5855 ± 6.7 (8 day)\t\n13\tBS25\t+\t++\t1120 ± 3.1 (6 day)\t1252 ± 1.9 (6 day)\t\n14\tCLBE1\t++\t++\t1944 ± 5.7 (6 day)\t2054 ± 9.3 (6 day)\t\n15\tCLBE2\t++\t++\t2031 ± 12.6 (6 day)\t2645 ± 10.5 (6 day)\t\n16\tCLBE14\t++\t+\t723 ± 5.3 (6 day)\t789 ± 2.3 (6 day)\t\n17\tCLBE15\t+\t\tND\tND\t\n18\tCLBE16\t+\t+\tND\tND\t\n19\tCLBE29\t+\t+\t22 ± 9.6 (6 day)\t88 ± 1.3 (6 day)\t\n20\tCLBE35\t+\t+\t34 ± 2.3 (4 day)\t54 ± 6.4 (4 day)\t\n21\tCLBE40\t+\t\t76 ± 4.5 (5 day)\t126 ± 2.7 (5 day)\t\n22\tCLBE41\t++\t+\t50 ± 1.3 (6 day)\t102 ± 6.3 (6 day)\t\n23\tCLBE44\t++\t+\t52 ± 1.7 (5 day)\t87 ± 0.7 (5 day)\t\n24\tCLBE49\t+++\t+\t401 ± 2.6 (6 day)\t654 ± 5.2 (6 day)\t\n25\tCLBE51\t++\t+\t565 ± 2.6 (7 day)\t843 ± 1.3 (7 day)\t\n26\tCLBE53\t++\t+\t774 ± 2.6 (6 day)\t1123 ± 5.5 (6 day)\t\n27\tCLBE54\t+++\t+\t454 ± 2.6 (17 day)\t732 ± 3.4 (17 day)\t\n28\tCLBE55\t+++\t+++\t20,000 ± 9.6 (12 day)\t24,233 ± 6.2 (12 day)\t\n29\tCLBE56\t+\t+\tND\tND\t\n30\tCLBE57\t+\t+\tND\tND\t\n31\tCLBE58\t+\t+\t122 ± 1.8 (9 day)\t176 ± 2.1 (9 day)\t\n\nND not detected laccase activity\n\n(+) Diameter of the oxidized zone 0–15 mm, (++) zone diameter 15–25 mm, (+++) zone diameter up to 25 mm\n\n\n\nSecondary screening: cultures on liquid media\nLaccase production by the fungal strains that were positive in the plate-test screening was further studied in liquid cultures.\n\nSecondary screening experiments with the selected isolates showed that the activity of laccase was higher with ABTS than with guaiacol. Else, the highest levels of laccase production were produced by the basidiomycetous especially white-rot fungi which confirms the results find in the qualitative test. The white-rot basidiomycete C. trogii (CLBE55) was isolated from decayed acacia wood from North West of Tunisia and selected for its potential of laccase production (Zouari-Mechichi et al. 2006). These results are in agreement with those of Gnanasalomi and Gnanadoss (2013) who reported the isolation of twenty-six basidomycetes that produce laccases.\n\nAs presented in Table 4, some fungal strains show laccase activity in a solid medium but not when cultured in a liquid medium. This may be explained by the need to create the proper conditions for laccase production for each isolate. In fact, the liquid medium (M7) was supported laccase production by basidiomycetes more than others taxonomic groups (Zouari-Mechichi et al. 2006). Some groups require such element in the cultures for laccase secretion.\n\nA similar trend toward laccase activity dependence on the cultivation medium and conditions was reported by Kiiskinen et al. (2004) and Colao et al. (2003).\n\nOn the contrary Ryu et al. (2003) explain the observed difference between the revelation of laccase activity in solid and liquid medium by the fungal strains may have produced other ligninolytic enzymes.\n\nTo demonstrate the potential for biotechnological applications of our laccase producing fungi, we used them in further experiments to select ligninolytic fungal isolates able to decolorize and detoxify textile dyes, a relevant effluent produced by Tunisian textile industries and an important pollutant in natural ecosystems in Tunisia (Zouari-Mechichi et al. 2006).\n\nLaccase-producing fungi with potential for textile dye decolorization\nLigninolytic systems, especially laccases, are directly involved in the degradation of various xenobiotic compounds and dyes. Their capacities to remove and decolorize dyes from textile industry effluents make them a useful tool for bioremediation purposes (Zouari-Mechichi et al. 2006).\n\nAs previously mentioned, 63 % of laccase-producing fungi were found among the fungal isolates by qualitative test on plates. The ligninolytic activity of the 31 laccase-producing fungi was further confirmed by their ability to oxidize three commercial industrial dyes (RBBR, RB-5 and GL) (Fig. 1b). It was observed that all screened isolates positive with guaiacol were able to oxidase RBBR and GL. The correlation between the polymeric dyes and guaiacol was also good, as only one strain, BS17 (Byssochlamys spectabilis), was positive on guaiacol without being positive on polymeric dye indicators (Table 5). Our results suggest that color reactions with RBBR, GL and guaiacol are more easily detectable and these compounds can reliably be used for laccase activity screening. Moreover, strains able to oxidize the three dyes: anthraquinonic (RBBR), diazoic(RB-5) and phthalocyanine (GL), correlated well with each other in the oxidation of ABTS or guaiacol (diameter >15 mm). Some other strains were able to decolorize RBBR and GL but not RB-5 such as T. harzianum D11, Ilyonectria destructans D6, Coniochaeta sp. BS14, Phoma macrostoma CLBE1, Spencermartinsia viticola CLBE2, Gloeophyllum trabeum CLBE16, Thermomyces lanuginosus CLBE29, Perenniporia medulla-panis CLBE54, Phanaerochaete chrysosporium CLBE56 and CLBE57 and Alternaria brassicae CLBE58. This correlates with the recalcitrant nature of RB-5 as diazoic dye and the need of system-laccase mediator (SLM) for RB-5 degradation as reported in many studies (Daâssi et al. 2012).Table 5 Comparison of reactions of the isolated fungal strains with different indicators (4 mM guaiacol and dyes: RBBR, RB-5 and GL) on malt extract agar plates\n\nNo.\tFungal isolates\tMycelial growth and oxidation characteristics\tOxidation of dyes\t\nColour zone diameter (mm)a\n\tOxidation scaleb\n\tFungal colony diameter(mm)c\n\tRBBR\tRB-5\tGL\t\n1\tBS54\t22\t++\t29\t*\t*\t*\t\n2\tBS2\t21\t++\t30\t*\t*\t*\t\n3\tBS22\t15\t++\t29\t*\t*\t*\t\n4\tTM11\t21\t++\t18\t*\t*\t*\t\n5\tBS17\t10\t+\t33\t–\t–\t–\t\n6\tBS34\t25\t+++\t29\t*\t*\t*\t\n8\tD6\t8\t+\t12\t*\t–\t*\t\n9\tBS14\t10\t+\t17\t*\t–\t*\t\n10\tBS19\t32\t+++\t25\t*\t*\t*\t\n11\t11B\t31\t+++\t30\t*\t*\t*\t\n12\tA3\t21\t++\t29\t*\t*\t*\t\n13\tAD40\t24\t++\t30\t*\t*\t*\t\n14\tBS25\t12\t+\t18\t*\t*\t*\t\n15\tCLBE1\t15\t++\t20\t*\t–\t*\t\n16\tCLBE2\t18\t++\t25\t*\t–\t*\t\n17\tCLBE14\t21\t++\t27\t*\t*\t*\t\n18\tCLBE15\t12\t+\t17\t*\t*\t*\t\n19\tCLBE16\t10\t+\t18\t*\t–\t*\t\n20\tCLBE29\t14\t+\t19\t*\t–\t*\t\n21\tCLBE35\t12\t+\t18\t–\t*\t–\t\n22\tCLBE40\t14\t+\t20\t–\t*\t–\t\n23\tCLBE41\t18\t++\t22\t–\t*\t–\t\n24\tCLBE44\t20\t++\t18\t*\t–\t–\t\n25\tCLBE49\t21\t+++\t25\t*\t*\t*\t\n26\tCLBE51\t18\t++\t15\t*\t*\t*\t\n27\tCLBE53\t16\t++\t24\t–\t–\t–\t\n28\tCLBE54\t32\t+++\t24\t*\t–\t*\t\n29\tCLBE55\t22\t+++\t14\t*\t*\t*\t\n30\tCLBE56\t10\t+\t17\t*\t–\t*\t\n31\tCLBE57\t9\t+\t18\t*\t–\t*\t\n32\tCLBE58\t10\t+\t22\t*\t–\t*\t\n\naDiameter of the oxidized zone in mm (measured on the 7th day of cultivation)\n\n\nbOxidation scale measured on the 7th day of cultivation on selective- medium containing 4 mM guaiacol\n\n\ncDiameter of the mycelial colony in mm measured on the 7th day of cultivation (the initial disc 10 mm diameter)\n\n(+) Diameter of the oxidized zone 0–15 mm, (++) zone diameter 15–25 mm, (+++) zone diameter up to 25 mm, (–) absence of clarified zone, (*) presence of clarified zone\n\n\n\nDecolorization of synthetic dyes has been demonstrated using white rot basidiomycetes (Diwaniyan et al. 2010; Daâssi et al. 2013) such as P. chrysosporium (Gomaa, 2012), Ganoderma sp. (Ma et al. 2014), Trametes trogii (Zouari-Mechichi et al. 2006), Bjerkandera adusta (Choi et al. 2014) and Porostereum spadiceum (Tigini et al. 2013). Interestingly, our study shows the ability of some isolates belonging to ascomycete group to decolorize textile dyes. Only, few studies reported the capacity of ascomycetes in textiles dyes decolorization (Ashrafi et al. 2013).\n\nTaxonomical groups of lignin degrading fungi\nAll taxa were taxonomically identified using BLAST and phylogenetic analysis, selecting matches with similarity higher than 98 % to sequences in the GenBank database (E-value < 0.05). However, 3 taxa presented low matching similarity (<98 %). Those isolates that were identified with a similarity less than 98 % were; CLBE 1 with 82 % identity with P. macrostoma, A3 with 94 % similarity to T. versicolor and BS25 with 80 % similarity to P. spadiceum. CLBE 24 matched with 99 % similarity an uncultured fungus not yet described (Table 1).\n\nThe 51 fungal isolates obtained in this study were classified into different taxa, representing 25 fungal genera and 29 species. Most of the isolates were found to belong to the phylum Ascomycota (67 %), some Basidiomycota (29 %) and only few Mucoromycotina (2 %) and non-identified uncultured fungi (2 %, Table 2). Ascomycetes found in this study derived from the orders Hypocraceales (27 %), Eurotiales (14 %), Pleosporales (14 % strains), Sordariales (2 %), Capnodiales (2 %), Coniochaetales (6 %) and Botryosphaeriales (2 %). Some researchers suggested a main contribution of ascomycetes in wood degradation (Nilsson and Daniel 1989; Michelotti et al. 2012). Guu et al. (2007) reported nineteen fungal isolates of the family of Nectriaceae collected from forests in Taiwan.\n\nAdditionally, a wide distribution of white-rot fungi throughout basidiomycetes group was also observed (29 %). Within basidiomycetes, the order polyporales was the most represented (25 %) followed by gloeophyllales (4 %). Among wood-rotting fungi, white-rot basidiomycetes are the most efficient in extensive lignin degradation (Blanchette et al. 1992). Brown-rot fungi presented by gloeophyllales order cause also the most destructive type of decay in wooden structures, although their biodegradation mechanisms are still relatively unknown (Schilling et al. 2009).\n\nA general phylogenetic tree was generated with sequences obtained from the amplification of the ITS rDNA region and some sequences from the GenBank database (Fig. 1). Duplicates as well as diverging sequences were deleted to make it possible to draw the tree. It was observed that Polyporales (13 isolates) followed by Pleosporales and Eurotiales (7 isolates each), were the most represented orders in the tree.\n\nStrain BS25 is closely related to P. spadiceum (JX463661.1) and Ganoderma carnosum (JQ520163.1) (80 % similarity). This suggests that more sampling of environmental fungi and their ITS barcoding is necessary to allow accurate identifications of strains collected in surveys similar to this study. Blast search results showed that many genera such as: Trametes/Coriolopsis, have high similarity in DNA sequences suggesting that phylogenetic analysis is necessary to ascertain the phylogenetic positions of the isolates. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the affiliation of most species using ClustalW for alignment and Neighbour joining (Fig. 2).Fig. 2 Phylogenetic relationships of recovered fungi with selected database sequences based on ITS rDNA sequences. a The phylogram represents a maximum likelihood tree based on analyses of 43 taxa under the HKY model. b The tree was rooted with Microsporidia as outgroup. Bootstrap values higher than or equal to 50 % (1000 replicates) are shown at each branches\n\n\n\nFigure 2 presents the phylogenetic affinities of 51 Tunisian isolates with some closely related taxa retrieved from GenBank. Our phylogeny confirms a close relationship of BS54, AD 40, CLBE55 and BS22 species to the members of the genus Coriolopsis. Despite a very close similarity in DNA sequences and phylogenetic affiliation to C. trogii (CLBE55, AD40 and BS22), BS54 are confirmed to be Coriolopsis gallica. The genus Coriolopsis, as currently defined, is polyphyletic, with the type species as part of the Trametoid clade and at least two additional lineages occurring in the core polyporoid clade.\n\nConclusions\nOur findings contribute to the discovery of new fungal strains involved in lignocellulose degradation. The isolated strains are diverse and show a wide spectrum of species demonstrating the wide biodiversity of Tunisian forests. The newly isolated fungal strains belong to different taxonomic groups with various enzymatic activities: amylases, proteases, lipases and laccases, making their further study very interesting for industrial and environmental applications. Our results show that this new collection of isolates had a certain lignin degradation capacity and provide a new resource of microorganisms for dye decolorization.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOCX 18 kb)\n\n Supplementary material 2 (TIFF 104 kb)\n\n Supplementary material 3 (TIFF 150 kb)\n\n Supplementary material 4 (TIFF 126 kb)\n\n \n\nDalel Daâssi and Héla Zouari-Mechichi have contributed equally to this work.\n\nThe authors are grateful to Mr Abdelmajid Dammak from the National school of engineering of Sfax for revising the English language of the paper.

Level of expression of transgenes in transgenic plants is important to achieve desirable level of resistance against target insects. In order to achieve desirable level of expression, rice chloroplast transit peptide sequence was fused with synthetic cry2AX1 gene to target its protein in chloroplasts. Sixteen PCR positive lines of rice were generated by Agrobacterium mediated transformation using immature embryos. Southern blot hybridization analysis of T0 transgenic plants confirmed the integration of cry2AX1 gene in two to five locations of rice genome and ELISA demonstrated its expression. Concentration of Cry2AX1 in transgenic rice events ranged 5.0–120 ng/g of fresh leaf tissue. Insect bioassay of T0 transgenic rice plants against neonate larvae of rice leaffolder showed larval mortality ranging between 20 and 80 % in comparison to control plant. Stable inheritance and expression of cry2AX1 gene was demonstrated in T1 progenies through Southern and ELISA. In T1 progenies, the highest concentration of Cry2AX1 and mortality of rice leaffolder larvae were recorded as 150 ng/g of fresh leaf tissue and 80 %, respectively. The Cry2AX1 expression even at a very low concentration (120–150 ng/g) in transgenic rice plants was found effective against rice leaffolder larvae.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-015-0315-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nCry2AX1Transgenic riceInsect resistanceRice leaffolderissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nGlobally, more than 3 billion people depend on rice (Oryza sativa, L.) as their staple food, and by 2050 about 30 % more rice must be produced to meet the needs of the growing population (Brookes and Barfoot 2003). One of the major constraints in rice production, throughout the rice growing countries of the world, is the menace of insect pests. Among them the lepidopteran insects, such as yellow stem borer (YSB) (Scirphophaga incertulus Walker), striped stem borer (SSB) (Chilo supressalis Walker) and rice leaffolder (RLF) (Cnaphalocrosis medinalis Guenee) are the major ones, causing significant yield losses up to 10 and 30 % on an average, respectively, each year (Krishnaiah and Varma 2012). The uses of chemical insecticides against the boring insects have not found much effective as the insecticides cannot reach them (Deka and Barthakur 2010). Chemical control besides increasing the cost of production also causes deleterious effects to the ecosystem. The development of insect-resistant lines in rice through conventional breeding has been a challenge due to non-availability of resistance source in germplasm collection (Bhattacharya et al. 2006). Thus, an alternative and the most attractive strategy is to employ the tools of genetic engineering to produce insecticidal proteins by introducing heterologus insecticidal genes.\n\nInsecticidal crystal protein gene (cry gene) of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is effective against important crop pests and widely used in plant genetic engineering. Bt mediated insect-resistant crop technology is the most successful application of agricultural biotechnology in today’s agriculture. Several crops such as tomato, cotton, maize and rice have been successfully transformed with different versions of crystal protein gene of Bt (Mandaokar et al. 2000; Sakthi et al. 2015; Jansen et al. 1997; Chen et al. 2005). The first transgenic rice plant with insect-resistant Bt protein (Cry1Ab) was reported by Fujimoto et al. (1993). Thereafter, several rice varieties have been transformed with genes encoding various Cry1A type Bt crystal proteins and have been shown to be resistant to one or more lepidopteran insect pests of rice (Nayak et al. 1997; Ye et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2014). First field trial of Bt rice was conducted in China in 1998 (Shu et al. 2000) and in 2009 China’s Ministry of Agriculture issued biosafety certificates for limited commercialization trial in Hubei Province in China for a 5-year period, 2009–2014 (Chen et al. 2011).\n\nThe large-scale deployment of transgenic crops expressing a single Bt toxin may lead to break-down of resistance in the field. To delay the resistance breakdown, the concept of gene pyramiding is advocated as one of the resistance management strategies. The cry2A genes are appropriate candidate for pyramiding with cry1A type gene due to variation in their structure and function. Use of synthetic genes expressing hybrid Bt toxins with increased potency is a promising strategy in genetic engineering.\n\nA chimeric Bt gene, cry2AX1 with part of sequence from cry2Aa and cry2Ac was developed in our laboratory to improve the insecticidal activity against a lepidopteran pest, Helicoverpa armigera. The chimeric Cry2AX1 protein exhibited higher level of toxicity than their parental proteins, Cry2Aa and Cry2Ac (Udayasuriyan et al. 2010). The Cry2AX1 protein isolated from recombinant Bt strain was also found to be effective against rice leaffolder. This chimeric gene was codon optimized to improve expression in crop plant (NCBI Accession Number GQ332539.1).\n\nAnother concern to be addressed while expressing Bt genes is optimal level of expression for desirable level of protection of crop plants against the target insect pest. One of the promising approaches is to target proteins to specific subcellular sites/compartments of plant cells, such as the chloroplast (Staub et al. 2000). Previously, Jang et al. (1999) reported that the targeting of foreign gene products to plastids using the transit peptide sequence increased the protein product levels in transgenic rice plants.\n\nIn the present study, we developed transgenic rice plants with codon optimized synthetic cry2AX1 gene (fused with rice chloroplast transit peptide sequence) using Agrobacterium mediated transformation. The insect bioassay results indicated that the transgenic plants expressing synthetic cry2AX1 gene were resistant to rice leaffolder.\n\nMaterials and methods\nConstruction of plant expression vector and rice transformation\nThe chimeric cry2AX1 gene was constructed using DNA sequences corresponding to the 585 N-terminal and 48 C-terminal amino acids of Cry2Aa and Cry2Ac, respectively, which were isolated from indigenous strains of Bt. The amino acid sequence of Cry2AX1 differs from that of Cry2Aa for ten residues in a stretch of 24 amino acids (595–618) (Udayasuriyan et al. 2010). Codon optimised, synthetic cry2AX1 gene (Accession Number GQ332539.1) was translationally fused at its 5′ end to the rice chloroplast transit peptide (rtp) sequence of rbcS gene (DNA of 148 bp corresponding to the rice rbcS transit peptide (rtp; Jang et al. 1999). The fusion gene driven by maize ubiquitin constitutive promoter was cloned in pUH binary vector (Agarwal et al. 2002) which harbours hptII (coding for hygromycin phosphotransferase), a plant selectable marker gene. The above construct, pUH-rtp-2AX1 (Fig. 1) was mobilized into disarmed Agrobacterium strain, LBA4404 for rice transformation experiments. A popular rice variety, ASD16 was used for transformation. The Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was carried out according to the protocol described by Hiei and Komari (2008). Regenerated putative transgenic plants were maintained in transgenic greenhouse (Fig. 2).Fig. 1 T-DNA region of plant transformation construct pUH-rtp-2AX1. Rice chloroplast transit peptide (ctp) was fused to cry2AX1 gene. The rtp-cry2AX1 gene is driven by a maize ubiquitin1 promoter and terminated by the nopaline synthase (nos) terminator. The plant selectable marker gene, hptII is under the control of the CaMV35S promoter and tailed by the CaMV35S polyA. LB and RB indicate left border and right border of T-DNA\n\nFig. 2 \nAgrobacterium-mediated transformation of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv.

These primers amplify 800 and 630 bp internal fragments of cry2AX1 and hptII genes, respectively. The plasmid DNA (pUH-rtp-2AX1) was used as positive control and DNA isolated from non-transformed control plants and the reaction mix without template DNA were used as negative control. The amplified PCR products were resolved on 1.2 % agarose gel, visualized on UV transilluminator upon ethidium bromide staining.Table 1 List of primers used for polymerase chain reaction in the study\n\nPrimer name\tNucleotide sequence\tAmplicon size\t\nS2XSF2\tCCTAACATTGGTGGACTTCCAG\t~800 bp internal sequence of cry2AX1 gene\t\nS2XSR2\tGAGAAACGAGCTCCGTTATCGT\t\nHF1\tGCTGTTATGCGGCCATTGGTC\t~630 bp internal sequence of hptII gene\t\nHR1\tGACGTCTGTCGAGAAGTTTG\t\nActF1\tGAGCGTTTCCGCTGCCCTGA\t~500 bp internal sequence of Actin gene\t\nActR1\tAGAAACAAGCAGGAGGACGGC\t\n\n\nTotal genomic DNA was extracted from young leaf tissues of transformed plants of both T0 and T1 generation and non-transformed plants using the method described by Dellaporta et al. (1983). For Southern blot analysis, five µg of genomic DNA was digested overnight with HindIII, which has a recognition sequence at one end of the T-DNA. The digested DNA were separated on a 0.8 % agarose gel, and then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane using 20X saline-sodium citrate (SSC) following standard capillary transfer protocol. The transferred DNA was cross-linked by a UV crosslinker at 1200 μJ min−1 for 1 min. The prehybridisation was carried out for 1 h and hybridization for 18 h at 60 °C. For hybridization, PCR amplified 800 bp internal region of cry2AX1 gene was used as a probe. The probe DNA was labelled with α32P dCTP using Decalabel DNA labelling kit (Thermo Scientific Inc) and added to hybridization solution. After hybridization, the blot was washed with 3X SSC + 0.1 % SDS and 2X SSC + 0.1 % SDS for 15 min each, followed by 10 min in 0.5X SSC + 0.1 % SDS. All washings were carried out at 60 °C and the blot was exposed to X-ray film.\n\nRT-PCR analysis\nTotal RNA was isolated from PCR positive T1 plants along with a control plant using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MBI Fementas, UK). The primers used for cry2AX1 gene were same as used in PCR assay. The ActF1 and ActR1 primers were used for amplification of actin gene which was used as internal control (Table 1).\n\nExpression of Cry2AX1 protein in transgenic rice plants\nThe PCR positive T0 transgenic rice plants were subjected for quantitative ELISA at 30 DAS. In T1 progenies the concentration of Cry2AX1 protein was measured at three different phenological stages viz. vegetative (25 DAS), tillering (55 DAS) and reproductive (85 DAS) stages, for studying the temporal variation of cry2AX1 gene expression. About 30 mg of tissues from top of the primary tiller in a plant was used for analysis. The tissue were homogenized in 500 µl of extraction buffer, spun at 3000g at 4 °C for 10 min and 100 µl of the supernatant was immediately used for assay. Each sample was replicated twice. Cry2AX1 protein expression in transgenic rice plants was determined by ELISA kit (Envirologix, USA) following standard procedures. The protein concentration was calculated on a linear standard curve, using the standards provided in the kit.\n\nDetached leaf bit bioassay\nBioassay studies for leaffolder resistance was conducted on ELISA positive T0 and T1 transgenic rice plants to study efficacy of the Cry2AX1 protein. Adults of rice leaffolder were collected from the rice field at Paddy Breeding Station, TNAU, Coimbatore and they were released on susceptible TN1 rice plants maintained in insect cages (65 cm × 65 cm × 75 cm) for culturing. After two generations, the neonate larvae of C. medinalis were used for the bioassay. Leaves of transgenic plants (35 days old seedling) were cut into pieces (about 3 cm length) and three leaf bits were placed on a moist filter paper in a plastic petriplate. Ten neonate larvae of rice leaffolder were released in each petriplate. A control was maintained using leaf bits collected from non-transgenic rice ASD16. Three replications were maintained and the experiment was carried out at 25 °C ± 1, 60 % relative humidity. Larval growth and mortality was recorded every day up to 5 days. After 5 days, leaf area damage and surviving larval characteristics were evaluated in transgenic as well as control plants. Percentage of leaf area damage was calculated using the formula: Leaf area damage%=Consumed leaf areaTotal leaf area×100. \n\nStatistical analysis\nValues for concentration of Cry2AX1 protein and mortality of rice leaffolder are reported as mean ± SD. The association between protein expression and insect mortality was studied by correlation analysis using the Statistical Package for Social Studies (SPSS) software version 16.\n\nResults\nMolecular and biochemical analyses of putative T0 transgenic plants\nTwenty putative transgenic rice lines were regenerated and putative transgenic plants were transferred to greenhouse for molecular analyses (Fig. 2). Total genomic DNA from putative rice transformants was subjected to PCR analysis with cry2AX1 and hptII gene specific primers. Out of 20 plants regenerated, 16 were found to be positive for the amplification of ~800 bp (Fig. 3a) and 630 bp internal sequences of cry2AX1 and hptII gene, respectively. Southern hybridization analysis showed two hybridization signals (range 6.7–12.0 kbp) in eight of the 16 plants analyzed whereas the remaining eight plants had three to five signals (range 6.5–19.0 kbp). The non-transformed control plant did not show any hybridization signals (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3 Molecular analysis of T0 Transgenic rice plants. a A 800 bp internal sequence of cry2AX1 gene was amplified by PCR from the DNA isolated from putative transgenic plants.

All the 16 PCR positive plants were found positive for the expression of Cry2AX1 protein. The expression of Cry2AX1 protein in these transgenic rice lines ranged 10.40–120.50 ng/g fresh leaf tissue (Table 2). One of the T0 plants, UR11 recorded maximum level of expression of Cry2AX1 protein i.e., 120.50 ng/g fresh leaf weight.Table 2 Quantitative ELISA and rice leaffolder bioassay on T0 rice lines expressing cry2AX1 gene\n\nRice line\tCry2AX1 concentration in fresh leaf tissuea Mean ± SD\tMortality of C. medinalis\nb (%)\t\nUR1\t22.45 ± 0.85\t30.00 ± 0.00\t\nUR2\t30.80 ± 0.80\t30.00 ± 0.00\t\nUR3\t38.30 ± 1.70\t30.00 ± 0.00\t\nUR4\t68.00 ± 2.00\t50.00 ± 0.00\t\nUR5\t23.30 ± 0.00\t30.00 ± 0.00\t\nUR6\t22.45 ± 0.85\tNT\t\nUR7\t24.15 ± 0.85\t23.33 ± 5.77\t\nUR8\t12.45 ± 0.85\tNT\t\nUR9\t35.00 ± 0.00\t43.33 ± 5.77\t\nUR10\t94.00 ± 1.00\t50.00 ± 0.00\t\nUR11\t120.50 ± 0.50\t80.00 ± 0.00\t\nUR12\t29.50 ± 0.50\t33.33 ± 5.77\t\nUR13\t38.00 ± 0.00\t43.33 ± 5.77\t\nUR14\t20.80 ± 1.60\tNT\t\nUR15\t14.40 ± 0.00\tNT\t\nUR16\t10.40 ± 0.80\tNT\t\nControl\t0\t0.0\t\n\nNT not tested, SD standard deviation\n\n\naMean of two replications\n\n\nbMean of three replications\n\n\n\nInheritance studies\nThirty plants of T1 progenies derived from transgenic rice line UR11 (selected based on relative levels of Cry2AX1 protein in T0 generation) were established in the greenhouse for further studies on gene inheritance, expression and efficacy. An amplicon of ~800 bp was found in all the 30 T1 progenies for the presence of cry2AX1 gene, whereas no amplification was found in non-transgenic control plant. RT-PCR analysis on a randomly selected five T1 plants showed presence of transcripts of the cry2AX1 (Fig. 4b) and actin gene (Fig. 4a). Further, expression of Cry2AX1 protein in these plants was analyzed at three phenological stages viz, vegetative, tillering and reproductive and the concentration of Cry2AX1 protein varied from 96.00 to 155.00, 46.40 to 86.40 and 30.40 to 72.00 ng/g fresh leaf tissue, respectively (Fig. 4c). The Cry2AX1 protein level in seeds ranged 3.2–4.8 ng/g fresh seed (Supplementary Table 1). Genomic DNA from five ELISA positive T1 progeny plants of UR11 was digested by HindIII enzyme and subjected to Southern blot hybridization using cry2AX1 probe. All the five T1 progenies (UR11–1, UR11–2, UR11–3, UR11–4 and UR11–7) showed three hybridization signals of ~7.5, ~10.0 and ~14.5 kbp (Fig. 5).Fig. 4 \na RT-PCR analysis of rice actin (housekeeping gene) in T1 transgenic plants.

The larval mortality ranged 23.33–80.00 % (Table 2). A significant, positive correlation was found between the concentration of Cry2AX1 and insect mortality in T0 transgenic plants (r = 0.920, p = 0.01). No larval mortality was observed on control plants and the major portion of the leaf tissue was consumed by the surviving larvae over a period of 5 days (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\nThe efficiency of T1 transgenic plants (Three T1 progeny plants) expressing Cry2AX1 protein (which expressed relatively higher levels of Cry2AX1 protein) with respective controls were tested against the neonates of rice leaffolder. Mortality in rice leaffolder varied from 53.33 to 80.00 % in the T1 transgenic rice plants (Table 3). The percentage of leaf area damaged by rice leaffolder larvae varied from 20.29 to 36.32 % in the T1 transgenic lines compared to 92.73 % in control plants (Fig. 6).Table 3 Detached leaf bit bioassay on T1 transgenic rice plants expressing cry2AX1 gene\n\nS. no.\tProgeny no.\t\nC. medinalis mortalitya (%) (56 DAS) Mean ± SD\tLeaf area damagea (%)\t\n1\tUR11–1\t63.33 ± 4.71\t32.26 ± 0.64\t\n3\tUR11–3\t80.00 ± 0.00\t20.29 ± 1.06\t\n4\tUR11–4\t53.33 ± 4.71\t36.32 ± 0.85\t\n6\tControl\t0\t92.73 ± 0.43\t\n\naMean of three replicates\n\nFig. 6 Detached leaf bit bioassay against rice leaffolder (C. medinalis) in T1 transgenic rice plants expressing Cry2AX1 protein. a Non transformed control plant (ASD16); b and c transformed rice plant (UR11–3 and UR11–4); d, e and f size of survivor from non transformed and transformed rice plants\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nTransgenic plants with insecticidal crystal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis could drastically reduce the use of broad-spectrum insecticides against insect pests. However, there is a risk that insect could become resistant to the Bt toxin. Therefore, it is envisaged that gene pyramiding in transgenic plants could be apossible strategy for simultaneous expression of two or more cry genes (Datta et al. 2002). To improve the insecticidal property of the Cry toxin, a chimeric Bt gene (cry2AX1) was developed with cry2Aa and cry2Ac sequences from indigenous isolates of Bt. Our earlier study proved that the chimeric Cry2AX1 protein expressed in Bt was highly toxic to the larvae of the rice leaffolder, C. medinalis (Manikandan et al. 2014).\n\nA number of studies have suggested that chloroplasts are ideal sites for the expression of transgenes (Jang et al. 1999; Kim et al. 2009; Verma and Daniell 2007). Earlier studies reported improved levels of expression of foreign genes by targeting them to the chloroplast in transgenic tobacco, cotton and rice (Jang et al. 1999; Kim et al. 2009; Rawat et al. 2011). In the present study, we introduced a codon optimised synthetic cry2AX1 gene driven by ubiquitin promoter with rice chloroplast transit peptide for targeting Cry2AX1 protein into the chloroplast.\n\nIn this study, twenty putative transformants of rice were generated on hygromycin selection, of which 16 plants were found to be positive for the cry2AX1 gene in PCR assay. The presence of transgene was confirmed by expression analysis of 16 PCR positive T0 transgenic plants by ELISA. All the 16 primary transformants gave positive results for the expression of Cry2AX1 protein and concentration of Cry2AX1 protein in putative transformants ranged 10.40–120.50 ng/g of leaf tissue on fresh weight. Similar variation in expression level was reported by earlier researcher on Bt rice (Wu et al. 2001). Genetic background and gene constructs were shown to influence the level of expression (Maqbool et al. 2001; Breitler et al. 2000; Meiyalaghan et al. 2006). Plant to plant variation in expression is mainly due to integration of transgenic DNA into regions of the genome that are transcriptionally repressed (heterochromatin), which ultimately leads to transgene silencing. These types of position effects often result in the production of transgenic lines exhibiting high and low levels of expression (De Bolle et al. 2003).\n\nStable integration of transgene was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis and Southern results indicated integration of cry2AX1 gene at two to five locations in the rice genome. In most of the cases, integration of cry2AX1 gene was at two loci (a relatively simple pattern) and in a few cases, it was 3–5 (complex pattern). Several earlier researchers reported that single copy transgenes had exhibited higher expression levels than multiple T-DNA insertions (Hobbs et al.1990; Jones et al. 1987). However, we observed that level of expression of transgene and resistance was higher in the multiple copy line UR11 compared to other transgenic lines. Zaidi et al. (2009) also reported that the level of Cry1C expression was higher in transgenic rice plant with three copies of cry1C gene when compared to single copy plants.\n\nDetached leaf bit bioassay of the selected T0 plants against neonate larvae of rice leaffolder revealed significant variability in larval mortality. The mortality varied from 23.33 to 80.00 % among the T0 transformants. The effect of the Cry2AX1 protein was also seen on the larva as there was considerable differences in the size of the larva that fed on the transgenic and wild type. Correlation between the Cry2AX1 protein expression and larval mortality showed a highly significant positive relationship (r = 0.920) indicating that higher the concentration of Cry2AX1 protein has resulted in higher mortality of the larvae. Transformants expressing higher levels of Cry2AX1 protein invariably induced higher larval mortality.\n\nThe T1 progenies of one of the primary transformants (UR11) were subjected to PCR analysis to determine the stable inheritance of transgene. The Mendalian segregation ratio could not be determined due to smaller size (30) of the T1 progeny. Southern hybridization analysis revealed three integrations of cry2AX1 gene in five of the T1 progenies tested at random (event UR11).\n\nTemporal variation of Cry2AX1 protein was quantified in T1 transgenic rice plants (Five T1 progeny plants) at three phenological stages (vegetative, tillering and reproductive). The results showed a decline in expression of Cry2AX1 when the crop progressed towards the maturity. The level of expression was relatively higher at vegetative stage when compared to other growth periods. One of the progenies i.e., UR11–3 showed the highest level of expression 155.00 ng/g of fresh leaf weight and the transgenic seeds showed significantly low level of expression varying from 3.2 to 4.8 ng/g fresh seed. The ELISA results indicated that the expression of Cry2AX1 protein in leaves decreased towards the end of growing season. Similar results were also reported in previous researches on Bt rice (Wu et al. 2001; Zhao et al. 2004; Han et al. 2009). Wan et al. (2005) reported that expression pattern of Bt toxin in progenies of cotton varies within the season with higher concentration at the beginning and lower at the latter stages. The possible reason for reduction of Bt protein expression is that the level of cry gene transcripts decreased in plant tissues as they mature and is likely because of decreased activity of the promoters, which is probably hindered by adverse physiological conditions in the rice plants (Christensen et al. 1992). Bakhsh et al. (2012) reported that the reduction of Bt protein content in later season of cotton tissue could be attributed to the over expression of the Bt gene at earlier stage, which leads to gene regulation at post-transcriptional level and consequently results in gene silencing at a later stage.\n\nInsect bioassay on T1 transgenic rice plants resulted in larval mortality ranging from 53.33 to 80.00 % with a low level of leaf damage (20.29–36.32 %) whereas in control plant there was no mortality and major portion of leaf tissue (92.73 %) was consumed by surviving larvae over the period of 5 days. The larvae recovered from control plants were well-developed and progressed to next instar (third instar), while the larvae recovered from those of transgenic plants were dead or sluggish, weak and underdeveloped. The reduction in the larval size was evident among the larvae tested on the transgenic rice in the bioassay. This may be because of low level of feeding, which in turn resulted in reduced accumulation of toxins in insects that did not cause the mortality but brought about the reduction in size.\n\nIt has been demonstrated by earlier researchers that the Cry protein concentration is directly related to the level of insect-resistance. Chen et al. (2005) reported an insect mortality of 100 % against rice stem borer in plants with average level of Cry2A protein expression of 10 µg/g fresh weight. Riaz et al. (2006) reported a concentration of Cry1Ac protein ranging between 4.6 and 16 µg/g and Cry2A at a level of 0.34–1.45 µg/g of tissue in leaves of transgenic rice plants. In our studies, the generated cry2AX1 transgenic rice plants showed low level of Cry2AX1 expression. Therefore, the level of expression of Cry protein reported by earlier workers indicate that a relatively higher level of cry2AX1 gene expression may be necessary for a desirable level of insecticidal activity in rice plants and this can be achieved by generating and screening more number of putative transformants.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOCX 736 kb)\n\n \n\nWe thank Prof. Dr. S.

This in vivo study was undertaken to verify the above ameliorative properties of Z. nummularia root methanolic extract. Various fractions of the extract were assayed on Balb/c mice by open field, Brewer’s yeast-induced hyperthermia and acetic acid-induced writhing experiments. The significance of the outcomes was analyzed with statistical tests. Various fractions of the extract exhibited marked dose-dependent (p < 0.05) sedative-hypnotic and antipyretic activities. The biological efficacies were most pronounced between 50 and 100 mg/kg. Further, the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions were significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated by the extract. Chloroform fraction of the extract was most dominant followed by ethyl acetate. The demonstrated therapeutic attributes of Z. nummularia extract can be exploited to isolate pharmaceutically relevant compounds.\n\nKeywords\nZiziphus nummulariaSedativeHypnoticAntipyreticAntinociceptiveAnti-inflammationissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nSince the dawn of human race, plants are being used as medicines (Petrovska 2012). World Health Organization (WHO) statistics reflects that 80 % of the world population, mostly from developing countries still rely on botanical for health care (Khan 2014). A vast majority of conventional drugs and most of the complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are plant-derived (Mainardi et al. 2009). For their benign toxicity compared to chemotherapeutics, phytochemicals are widely used against a plethora of infectious, metabolic and degenerative diseases (Pandey and Rizvi 2009). The health restorative applications of plant products are exhaustive, yet the significant are antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-diabetic, analgesic, antimicrobial, antiulcer, etc. (Benzie and Wachtel-Galor 2011). The key phytochemicals have been characterized to be alkaloids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, sterols, saponins, tannins, etc., though each species has its distinct botanical repertoire. Most plants are geographically confined and the medicinal uses largely hinge on their local distribution and traditional knowledge on them (Saslis-Lagoudakis et al. 2014).\n\n\nIn this resource-depleted world, sustainability requires the search for food and medicine in the vicinity (Cordell 2011). Ziziphus is a genus in family Rhamnaceae with global distribution (Zhao et al. 2014). The common species of this genus are Z. jujube, Z. zizyphus, Z. mauritiana, Z. joazeiro, Z. lotus, Z. spina-christi, Z, spinosa, Z. oxyphylla, Z. oenoplia and Z. oxyphylla Edgew (Pawlowska et al. 2009). The ethnobotanical, phytochemical, economical, and pharmacological attributes of many species have been extensively studied. Some popular food and medicinal uses of this genus have been mentioned below. The drupes ‘jujube or Chinese dates’ are nutritious and popular fruits (Gao et al. 2013b). They are often processed into pulps, polysaccharides, antioxidants, pickles, jam, fermented (masau) (Adeli and Samavati 2014; Li et al. 2014; Elaloui et al. 2015). Usage of this genus as dietary supplements and herbal medicines in Tunisia (Elaloui et al. 2015), China (Plastina et al. 2012), Japan (Oshima et al. 2015), Korea (Kim et al. 2013), and other Asian countries (San et al. 2013) have been well-documented (Chen et al. 2014b). Many of the folkloric practices have been empirically validated now. The verified health benefits include antioxidant (Olajuyigbe and Afolayan 2011; Chen et al. 2014c), anti-inflammation (Yu et al. 2012), antibacterial and antifungal (Ghazghazi et al. 2014), antiulcerogenic (Wahida et al. 2007), immunomodulatory (Chen et al. 2014a), diabetes ameliorating (Goli-malekabadi et al. 2014), hepatoprotective (Kwape et al. 2013; Yue et al. 2014), hematopoietic (Chen et al. 2014b), antimutagenic (Boriollo et al. 2014), cytotoxic (Jafarian et al. 2014), and sedative-hypnotic (Gao et al. 2013a). The plant parts conferring the biological effects are diverse such as leaves (Nisar et al. 2007; Kwape et al. 2013; Goyal et al. 2013), fruits (Plastina et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2014a, b, c), seeds (Cao et al. 2010; San et al. 2013; Gao et al. 2013a), bark (Olajuyigbe and Afolayan 2011; Boriollo et al. 2014) and root (Rao et al. 2012).\n\nZiziphus nummularia, is a species of the above genus, and native to the arid regions of India (Bachaya et al. 2009), Pakistan (Abbasi et al. 2013), Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, and Israel (Desai et al. 2008). The versatile uses of this species have been depicted in an insightful review (Pandey et al. 2010). Ethnobotanical survey for wild edible and medicinal plants have projected it as a major species in tribal communities of Lesser Himalayas-Pakistan (Abbasi et al. 2013). This plant is known for its palatable and vitamic C-rich drupes. Literature search reflects its usage as an astringent, treatment of scabies and other skin diseases (Khare 2003). Its use as antidiarrheal in Sariska region of India (Upadhyay et al. 2011) and anthelmintic in Pakistan (Bachaya et al. 2009) is prevalent. Also, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy of its cyclopeptide alkaloid-rich leaf extract has been reported (Goyal et al. 2013). However, there is no information of its beneficial role in insomnia, anxiety, pain, and fever. Though, some other species of Ziziphus genus have been proven effective in easing those ailments such as Z. jujube (Jiang et al. 2007; Cao et al. 2010; Yeung et al. 2012; Awad et al. 2014), Z. oxyphylla Edgew (Nisar et al. 2007; Kaleem et al. 2013), Z. mauritiana (San et al. 2013). So, this in vivo study was undertaken to evaluate the sedative-hypnotic, antipyretic and analgesic activities of Z. nummularia root extracts as a pharmacological justification of its traditional usage and premise for future drug discovery (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 The overview of Z. nummularia extract eliciting sedative, hypnotic, antipyretic, analgesics effect in balb/c mice\n\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nPlant material\nThe roots of Z. nummularia were collected from Takht Bhai District Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The plant was identified and authenticated by Professor Dr. Abdur Rashid, a botanist at the Botany Department, University of Peshawar, Pakistan. A voucher specimen (BOT 200399) has been deposited in the herbarium of the department of Botany, University of Peshawar, Pakistan.\n\nExperimental animals\nBalb/c mice of both gender, each weighing about 24–26 g were kept under standard laboratory conditions at (25 ± 4 °C). The animals were fed with a laboratory diet and water ad libitum. All experiments were performed at the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR), University of Peshawar, Pakistan and were approved by the local Ethical Committee of the Peshawar University, Pakistan.\n\nExtraction and fractionation\nThe root fragments of Z. nummularia were shade-dried at room temperature followed by coarse grinding. The powdered material (300 g) was exhaustively extracted with 99 % methanol for 7 days. The extract was concentrated and dried in a rotary evaporator and which yielded 38 g of brownish mass. The solid mass was suspended in water and successively fractionated with various solvents of increasing polarity, and the corresponding fractions of n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and ethanol were obtained.\n\nSedative activity (open field test)\nThe sedative effect of the crude extract was evaluated according to published procedures using the open field method (Walsh and Cummins 1976). This method has been proven effective in the assessment of locomotor activity and anxiety-linked behaviors (Lau et al. 2008). The apparatus used for the test consisted of a white wooden area (150 cm in diameter) enclosed in stainless steel walls and the area was divided by black lines, into four squares. The open field was placed inside a light and sound-attenuated room. The mice were adapted to red light (40 W) for 60 min prior to the start of experiment and fed ad libitum. The animals were administered with normal saline and Z. nummularia root extract at the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg. After 30 min of the treatment, each mouse was placed in the center of the box and the numbers of lines crossed were counted.\n\nHypnotic properties in phenobarbitone-induced sleeping time\nThe test mice were divided into groups of six each. Mice of the control group (negative control) were orally treated with normal saline (10 ml/kg) whereas those of the positive control group were given the standard drug bromazepam (5 mg/kg). This drug, from the class benzodiazepines (BZD) imparts short-term relief from anxiety by modulating the neurotransmitters in brain (Mandrioli et al. 2010). The remaining mice were treated with the Z. nummularia root extract at 50 and 100 mg/kg doses. After 30 min of treatment, all animals were injected with the barbiturate drug phenobarbitone sodium at a dose of 35 mg/kg and observed for onset and duration of sleep. The hypnotic effect of the extract was evaluated.\n\nBrewer’s-yeast-induced hyperthermia\nThe antipyretic activities of Z. nummularia root extract were assessed in Brewer’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-induced hyperthermia (Tomazetti et al. 2005). Pyrexia was induced in mice by injection of 10 ml/kg of 15 % suspension of yeast. The normal body temperature of the animals was recorded with a digital clinical thermometer (Hartmann, Germany) using rectum, while the tail was fastened with an adhesive tape. The rectal temperature of each mouse was measured again after 19 h of yeast injection as described above. Mice that developed a minimum increase of 0.5 °C or more temperature were selected for the experiment. These rodents were categorized in group of size 6. A group of mice was fed with saline (10 ml/kg) and used as negative control, whereas other groups was treated either with paracetmol (100 mg/kg through intraperitoneal injection) as standard drug or Z. nummularia root extract at the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg. After the respective treatment, the rectal temperature of each animal was again recorded at 1 h intervals for following 5 h. The obtained data were used for the calculation of percentage reduction in rectal temperature. Antipyretic activity was defined as the efficacy of test drug to abate the induced-pyrexia (Muhammad et al. 2013). Reduction in temperature%=B-CB-A×100 where A is the normal body temperature, B is the temperature after pyrexia induction, C is the temperature after 1, 3 and 5 h.\n\nAcetic acid-induced writhing test\nIntraperitoneal injection of acetic acid triggers writhing, most likely due to the release of TNF-α, interleukin 1β and interleukin 8 by macrophages and mast cells (Ribeiro et al. 2000). The mice were divided into groups of 6 for evaluation of the analgesic effect of Z. nummularia roots extract. One group was injected with normal saline (10 ml/kg) and used as negative control. Another group was injected with diclofenac (5 and 10 mg/kg). The last group was treated with Z. nummularia root extract at 50 and 100 mg/kg. The mice were injected with acetic acid (1 % intraperitoneal) and the subsequent abdominal constriction (writhing) was counted for 10 min after 5 min of acetic acid injection.\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for analysis of data followed by Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons (Hoffman et al. 2008). Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05.\n\nResults and discussion\nEffect of extract/fractions in open field test\nThe efficacy of intraperitoneally administered Z. nummularia root extract (50 and 100 mg/kg) and bromazepam in mice have been illustrated in Fig. 2. The extract showed marked sedative effect with decreased locomotion in dose-dependent manner. The chloroform fraction was the most dominant followed by ethyl acetate with (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) at 50 and 100 mg/kg.Fig. 2 Data shows the number of lines crossed by animals in a box, 30 min after treatment with normal saline (10 ml/kg, control), extract/fractions of Z. nummularia roots (50 and 100 mg/kg) or bromazepam (5 mg/kg). Values are given as mean ± S.E.M, (n = 6). *p < 0.05 or **p < 0.01, p < 0.001, all compared with control\n\n\n\nEffect of extract in open field test\nThe effect of Z. nummularia roots extract at 50 and 100 mg/kg, in phenobarbitone-sleep in mice is shown in Table 1. The extract significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the sleep latency time (time taken for the onset of sleep) and increased the sleep in dose-dependent manner. Chloroform followed by ethyl acetate extract was the most potent fraction in inducing sleep and increasing its duration. The soporific effect elicited by the extract in bromazepam treated group was highly significant (p < 0.001).Table 1 The effect of Z. nummularia root fractions in phenobarbitone-induced sleep in mice\n\nDrug\tIntraperitoneal dose\tOnset of sleep (min)\tDuration of sleep (min)\t\nNormal saline\t10 ml/kg + phenobarbitone\t23.27 ± 1.09\t7.56 ± 2.45\t\nCrude extract\t50 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t18.10 ± 2.70\t15.40 ± 1.75\t\n100 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t14.33 ± 1.08*\t23.88 ± 2.75*\t\nHexane\t50 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t19.66 ± 1.12\t9.45 ± 0.67\t\n100 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t19.00 ± 1.05\t9.60 ± 1.06\t\nChloroform\t50 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t15.33 ± 1.21*\t22.33 ± 1.12*\t\n100 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t10.56 ± 0.99**\t27.05 ± 1.35**\t\nEthyl acetate\t50 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t18.44 ± 1.12*\t20.12 ± 1.45*\t\n100 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t12.57 ± 1.49*\t23.67 ± 1.56*\t\nAqueous\t50 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t17.44 ± 1.06\t17.04 ± 0.99*\t\n100 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t13.03 ± 0.89*\t23.55 ± 1.77*\t\nBromazepam\t5 mg/kg + phenobarbitone\t3.25 ± 1.10***\t61.45 ± 1.10***\t\n* Data shows the onset and duration of sleep (in min) in mice pretreated with normal saline (10 ml/kg), extract/fractions (50 and 100 mg/kg) or bromazepam (5 mg/kg) and then all groups were treated with phenobarbitone (35 mg/kg).

The extract produced profound antipyretic effect in a dose-dependent manner during various assessment times (1–5 h). Additionally, the post chloroform treatment caused pronounced reduction in induced pyrexia with 45.77 and 67.44 % effect at 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively after 1 h of injection.Fig. 3 The percent antipyretic effect of extract/fractions of Z. nummularia roots in acetic acid-induced writhing.

As per the result, the extract significantly reduced pain sensation in acetic acid-induced writhing test. For all fractions of the extract, dose-dependent effects have been observed at 50 and 100 mg/kg, and the analgesic effect of chloroform fraction was most pronounced with 57.86 and 74.28 % at 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively.Fig. 4 The percent antinociceptive effect of extract/fractions of Z. nummularia roots in acetic acid-induced writhing.

The open field test is one of the commonly used behavioral test protocol for screening of sedative and anxiolytic activity of substances in laboratory animals (de la Peña et al. 2013), whereas the phenobarbitone-induced sleeping time test (Inganakal et al. 2012) is employed for the assessment of hypnotic properties. The roots extract significantly reduced the movement of mice in the open field test apparatus implying the tranquilizing nature of its components. While the precise mechanistic of therapeutic role is not known, several probable causes were formulated. The allosteric modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in mice brain might be the underlying mechanism (Shrestha et al. 2012). The prolongation of the sleeping duration suggested the hypnotic properties of the extract. The effect could have been mediated by the induction of central nervous system (CNS) depressant activity by the bioactive components of the extract (Ya’u et al. 2011). In this investigation, the crude extracts showed remarkable sedative-hypnotic effect which varied upon fractionation. The chloroform fraction was most potent followed by ethyl acetate whereas the hexane fraction did not produce significant results. From the results, it could be assumed that the sedative-hypnotic constituents of Z. nummularia roots are mostly concentrated in chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions. Results revealed that Z. nummularia root extract elicits antipyretic effects in yeast-induced hyperthermia in the murine models. Chloroform fractions proved to be the most active fraction followed by ethyl acetate, suggesting the presence of pharmacologically important components in them.\n\nThe acetic acid-induced writhing test is considered very effective in detecting antinociceptive effects of various extracts. Its sensitivity is much higher than other methods (hot plate, tail flick, carrageenan-induced paw edema, formalin-induced paw licking, etc.) used for this purpose (Ramirez et al. 2010). The abdominal constrictions and the resultant painful sensations provoked by the acid has been attributed to the perturbation and interplay of bradykinin, prostaglandins, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (Ribeiro et al. 2000). The Z. nummularia root extract at the doses of 50–100 mg/kg, moderated the abdominal constrictions in a dose-dependent manner. One possible mechanism of this action could be the diminished production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Ying et al. 2014). The extract could be interfering with both central (opioid and cholinergic pathways) and peripheral (COX-2) pathways in eliciting the anti-inflammatory effects (Sawada et al. 2014). The chloroform fraction was the most effective followed by the ethyl acetate fraction in reducing pain and sensitivity. It indicates the accumulation of the antinociceptive constituents in these fractions.\n\nAnxiety and sleep interruptions have become the norm of current stressful living (Han et al. 2012). Also, the instances of depression, suicidal attempts are soaring (Cash and Bridge 2009). Reliance on the prescription drugs is not free of side effects. The frequent intake aggregates the metabolic system in long term, becomes ineffective and overdose proves fatal. Opioid analgesics (buprenorphine, fentanyl, codeine, ativan, dextropropoxyphene, methadone, oxycodone, carisoprodol, etc.) overdose-caused death cases are rising dramatically (Paulozzi et al. 2012). The deadly combination opioid, benzodiazepines, and/or alcohol use poses huge risk of morbidity (Gudin et al. 2013). On the other hand, CAM are naturally sourced, thus pose lower genotoxicity compared to chemicals. In this regard, Z. nummularia root extract merits further investigation. Isolation of the functional constituents and their structural elucidation warrants impetus. In a preliminary screening study, the phytochemicals alkaloids (ziziphines), carbohydrates, saponins, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and tannins were found in the ethanolic extract of Z. oenoplia (Suksamrarn et al. 2005; Rao et al. 2012). These components might be instrumental in inducing the tested biological responses. The hypnotic efficacy of Z. jujuba Mill. jujubosides has been correlated to the impact on circadian rhythm and the serotonergic system (Cao et al. 2010). Further studies on the therapeutic importance of this plant might provide affordable medication to large section population in the developing countries. However, possible health risks must be verified for broader remedial applications.\n\nConclusion\nThe cumulative findings from this study suggest that the root extract of Z. nummularia exhibits remarkable sedative-hypnotic, antipyretic and analgesic effects in mice. These findings explain the rationale of traditional medicinal use of Z. nummularia for alleviating pain, fever, insomnia, seizures, muscle spasms, anxiety etc. However, more in-depth studies are required to establish the safety, efficacy, and active constituents of this plant. This study is expected to inspire further investigation into this underutilized medicinal plant.\n\nThe author Abdur Rauf is grateful for the financial support provided by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan and the Institute of Chemical Sciences, University of Peshawar, Pakistan under grant number 112-26510-2PS1-258.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors have declared that there is no conflict of interest.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAbbasi AM  Khan MA  Khan N  Shah MH   Ethnobotanical survey of medicinally important wild edible fruits species used by tribal communities of Lesser Himalayas-Pakistan J Ethnopharmacol 2013 148 528 536 10.1016/j.jep.2013.04.050 23665057 \nAdeli M  Samavati V   Studies on the steady shear flow behavior and chemical properties of water-soluble polysaccharide from Ziziphus lotus  fruit Int J Biol Macromol 2014 72C 580 587 25195543 \nAwad DS  Ali RM  Mhaidat NM  Shotar AM   Zizyphus jujuba  protects against ibuprofen-induced nephrotoxicity in rats Pharm Biol 2014 52 182 186 10.3109/13880209.2013.821665 24074058 \nBachaya HA  Iqbal Z  Khan MN    Anthelmintic activity of Ziziphus nummularia  (bark) and Acacia nilotica (fruit) against Trichostrongylid nematodes of sheep J Ethnopharmacol 2009 123 325 329 10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.043 19429379 \nBenzie IFF, Wachtel-Galor S (2011) Herbal medicine 2nd edition, Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects, Oxidative Stress and Disease.

Repeated use during the last two decades of the ACCase-inhibiting herbicide (clodinafop) to control this weed has resulted in the occurrence of resistance. Fifty-three P. minor populations were collected from wheat fields in Haryana and Punjab states of India. The dose–response assays indicated that 29 populations were resistant, 23 populations were susceptible and one population was moderately resistant to clodinafop. Sequence analysis of the CT domain of ACCase gene among resistant and susceptible populations revealed two non-synonymous mutations, Trp2027 to Cys and Ile2041 to Asn in the resistant populations. Allele-specific PCR markers were developed to differentiate between wild-type and resistant codons at positions 2027 and 2041 of ACCase in P. minor which enables molecular assays for rapid detection and resistance diagnosis for efficient weed management in wheat. This is the first report from India of a target site mutation corresponding to resistance to clodinafop in P. minor.\n\nKeywords\nAcetyl-coenzyme A carboxylaseHerbicide resistanceSingle nucleotide polymorphismMutationPhalaris minorissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nLittleseed canarygrass (Phalaris minor Retz.) is the most dominant winter season weed in wheat and widely distributed in wheat growing regions of the world. This weed has been reported from Macronesia to Mediterranean, Irano-Turanic and Saharo-Sindic regions, eastern and South Africa, North and South America, Australia and the Far East (Singh et al. 1999). In India, it is the major weed of the north-western and eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (Chhokar and Sharma 2008). Up until the early 1990s, P. minor was effectively controlled by isoproturon, a substituted urea herbicide, but after long period of continuous and heavy spraying along with poor application rates, spray techniques and timing led to the evolution of isoproturon resistance in P. minor (Malik and Singh 1995; Chhokar and Malik 2002). In 1997–1978, four alternative herbicides (sulfosulfuron, clodinafop, fenoxaprop and tralkoxydim) were recommended for its control and the majority of farmers accepted clodinafop due to excellent crop safety and efficacy against this weed. The excessive dependence on clodinafop resulted in evolution of weed resistance against this herbicide. At present, this weed has evolved multiple herbicide resistance across three modes of actions: photosynthesis at the photosystem II site A, acetyl CoA carboxylase and acetolactate synthase inhibition (Chhokar and Sharma 2008). Herbicide resistance in weeds is an evolutionary process and its dynamics and impact are dependent on several factors such as genetics and biology of weeds along with herbicidal, operational and other biological components (Powels and Yu 2010). There are currently 418 unique cases (species x site of action) of herbicide-resistant weeds globally, with 224 species (129 dicots and 95 monocots). Weeds have evolved resistance to 21 of the 25 known herbicide sites of action and to 149 different herbicides. Herbicide-resistant weeds have been reported in 73 crops in 61 countries (Heap 2014).\n\nAryloxyphenoxypropionate (APP) and cyclohexanedione (CHD) herbicides inhibit plastid form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by blocking the fatty acid biosynthesis which results in disruption of cell membrane integrity and consequently causing metabolite leakage and rapid plant death (Devine and Shimabukuro 1994). Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) (EC.6.4.1.2) is a key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis catalyzing ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. All ACCase isoforms contain three distinct functional domains: the biotin carboxyl carrier (BCC) as structural domain, and the biotin carboxylase (BC) and the carboxyl transferase (CT) domains as catalytic domains (Nikolau et al. 2003). The ACCase enzyme activity is inhibited by APP and CHD herbicides by binding within the CT domain of the plastidic ACCase in susceptible plant species and thus the CT domain of the ACCase gene determines the herbicide sensitivity in plants (Nikolskaya et al. 1999). Several point mutations have been reported in the CT domain of plastid-localized ACCase responsible for the enzyme insensitivity to herbicides in several grass weeds (reviewed by Kukorelli et al. 2013; Beckie and Tardif 2012; Powles and Yu 2010). Therefore, the search for mutations endowing ACCase herbicide resistance was conducted by sequencing the CT domain of the plastidic ACCase gene in P. minor. In this study, we elucidated that the amino acid substitutions in CT domain of plastidic ACCase gene are associated with herbicide resistance in P. minor. Allele-specific PCR-based test further confirmed the differentiation of herbicide-resistant and susceptible populations.\n\nMaterials and methods\nPlant material\nSeeds of 53 P. minor populations were collected during April 2013 from the wheat fields in Haryana and Punjab states of India. One population (G-46), an identified susceptible check for clodinafop, was also included in the study. Pot studies were conducted to determine the response of various populations to clodinafop. The pots were filled with soil from a field having previously no infestation of P. minor and well-rotten farm yard manure in 6:1 ratio (v/v) after passing through 2 mm sieve. The pots were frequently irrigated to deplete the soil seed bank, if any before sowing. The seedlings were established by seeding 50–60 seeds at a depth of 2.5 cm. After 2 weeks of emergence, thinning was done to maintain 15 plants per pot. The herbicide was sprayed at 3 leaf stages of P. minor with Knapsack sprayer fitted with flat fan nozzles. Herbicide treatments were clodinafop (Topik 15 WP; Syngenta India Ltd., Mumbai, India) at 0, 30 and 60 g/ha. Four weeks after spraying, the herbicide response was recorded and leaves of different populations were taken for DNA extraction. The leaf sample for DNA extraction were taken from the control (unsprayed) pots for the susceptible biotypes effectively controlled at ½ X dose (0.30 g/ha), whereas the leaf samples of resistant biotypes were taken from plants survived after spray of X (0.60 g/ha) dose of herbicide.\n\nDNA extraction and plastidic ACCase CT domain sequencing\nGenomic DNA was extracted from seedlings using CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle 1990). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in a 25-μL volume containing 100 ng of genomic DNA, 2.5 μL of 10× Taq PCR buffer, 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP, 0.2 μM of each primer and 1.0 unit of Taq DNA polymerase. The thermocycling program consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 60 s at 72 °C and a final cycle of 5 min at 72 °C in S 1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). The amplified product was separated by electrophoresis on 2 % (w/v) agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed under UV light.\n\nThe amplicons were purified using HiPurATM agarose gel DNA purification spin kit (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced with primers used for amplification from both the directions to minimize the false SNP due to sequencing artifacts. The sequencing was performed by Eurofins Genomics India Pvt. Ltd, Banglore, India). The sequence alignments were done using ClustalW2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) with default parameters and allele-specific primers were designed for SNPs (Table 1).Table 1 Primers used for sequencing and allele-specific PCR analysis of mutations\n\nPrimer\tSequence (5′–3′)\t\nT\nm (°C)\tExperiment\tReferences\t\nUp ACCase-B\tAAGGATGGGCGAAGACAGTAGTTA\t62\tSequencing\tGherekhloo et al.

The resistant populations were not affected by recommended dose (X dose) of clodinafop (60 g/ha), whereas susceptible populations were effectively controlled by ½ X dose (30 g/ha) of clodinafop (Table 2). The dose–response assays indicated that 29 populations were resistant, 23 populations were susceptible and one population was moderately resistant to clodinafop.Table 2 Response of various populations of P. minor to clodinafop\n\nVisual phytotoxicity (%)\tClodinafop (30 g/ha)\tClodinafop (60 g/ha)\t\n0–25\t–\tH-14, H-15, H-16, H-17, H-19, H-20, H-21, H-22, H-26, H-28, H-31, H-34, H-40, P-5, P-12, P-17, P-38, P-49, P-54, P-75, P-76, G-8, G-21, G-29, G-34, G-43, N-5, N-8, N-9\t\n26–50\t–\tH-13\t\n51–75\t–\t–\t\n76–100\tH-8, H-23, H-27, H-68, P-8, P13, P-14, P-26, P-30, P-35, P-43, P-60, P-63, P-69, G-2, G-6, G-18, G-39, G-40, G-42, G-46, G-47, N-4\t–\t\n\n\nTo identify the molecular basis of resistance, the CT domain of ACCase gene from five individuals of two resistant and two susceptible populations was sequenced (GenBank accession No. KF770792, KF770793, KF770794 and KF770795). The sequences were aligned with CT domain of plastidic ACCase genes of Alopecurus myosuroides (GenBank accession No. AJ310767). Two non-synonymous mutations were found in the resistant and susceptible biotypes of P. minor (Fig. 1). The nucleotide sequences of one resistant populations differed from susceptible by a single nucleotide substitution of G/T that resulted in substitution of Trp2027 to Cys in the resistant population, whereas a substitution of T/A resulted in substitution of Ile2041 to Asn (numbered according to the Alopecurus myosuroides plastid ACCase) in another resistant population.Fig. 1 Amino acid sequence comparisons of herbicide target site in the CT domain of ACCase gene. Mutations associated with resistance are shown with residue numbering following the full-length A. myosuroides plastid ACCase (GenBank accession No. AJ310767). The substitution found in the two resistant populations of Phalaris minor (R1 and R2) in comparison with two susceptible populations (S1 and S2) is highlighted at amino acid position at 2027 and 2041\n\n\n\nBased on the sequence analysis results for the mutation site, allele-specific PCR was designed from the position of base substitution to further characterize resistant and susceptible populations (Table 1). The rationale in designing the primers was based on the premise that the 3′-terminal positions ought to be unique for the herbicide-resistant biotype. The allele-specific primers were tested on 53 populations which were phenotyped for herbicide resistance. PCR fragment of 143 bp size was obtained from seven resistant populations with primer pair PM2027F/PM2027R associated with Trp2027 to Cys mutation, whereas no PCR product was amplified in susceptible populations (Fig. 2a). Similarly, a 221 bp DNA fragment was amplified from 15 resistant populations associated with Ile2041 to Asn mutations with PM2041F/PM2014R primer pair (Fig. 2b). Two populations (P49 and P54) found to possess both the point mutations based on PCR products. However, the remaining 10 resistant populations were not found to endow these point mutations associated with clodinafop resistance and may possess other mutations responsible for herbicide resistance.Fig. 2 Allele-specific PCR for ACCase mutations, a Trp2027 to Cys and b Ile2041 to Asn in herbicide-resistant populations of P. minor.\nM 100 bp DNA ladder, R resistant population, S susceptible population\n\n\n\nTwelve target site mutations (amino acid substitutions) in the ACCase gene have been documented till date in grass weed species (Beckie and Tardif 2012; Kaundun et al. 2013). The Trp2027 to Cys substitution has also been reported in Iranian P. minor populations to endow resistance to ACCase inhibitors (Gherekhloo et al. 2012) and the Ile2041 to Asn mutation has been reported in awned canary-grass (Phalaris paradoxa) in Israel (Hochberg et al. 2009). The Trp2027Cys and Ile2041Asn mutations confer resistance to APPs (fenoxaprop, clodinafop, haloxyfop). The Trp2027Cys mutation also confers resistance to pinoxaden, whereas Ile2041Asn pinoxaden may confer moderate resistance to pinoxaden. The both mutations were not found associated with resistance to CHDs (Petit et al. 2009; Scarabel et al. 2011). The experiments with yeast gene-replacement strains confirmed that single amino acid changes in Trp2027–Cys and Ile2041–Asn confer strong resistance to APPs and mild resistance to CHDs (Liu et al. 2007). The three-dimensional model of CT-herbicide complex in black-grass revealed that the Ile2041 to Asn substitution interferes with herbicide binding because of change in APP binding site (Délye et al. 2005). The Trp2027 to Cys substitution did not interfere with APP binding but resulted in small allosteric changes which might hamper the access of herbicide to the binding site (Délye et al. 2005). Another computational study on Trp2027 to Cys, Ile2041 to Asn, Asp2078 to Gly, and Gly2096 to Ala mutations suggested a large effect on conformation of the binding pocket and the hydrogen bonding interactions. The mutant-type ACCase has a lower affinity for inhibitor binding than the wild-type enzyme, which account for the molecular basis of herbicide resistance (Zhu et al. 2009).\n\nResistance to herbicides in weeds is increasing rapidly worldwide and threatening global food security. Resistance has now been reported to all major herbicide modes of action despite the development of resistance management strategies in the 1990s. Herbicide resistance is now widely recognized as the result of the adaptive evolution of weed populations to the intensive selection pressure exerted by herbicides. The least herbicide-sensitive individuals repeatedly sprayed with herbicide have a selective advantage in the weed populations and thus increase in frequency until populations shift towards a predominance of herbicide-resistant individuals (Délye et al. 2013). With patents expiring on many ACC inhibitors worldwide, greater usage of these herbicides as a consequence of falling prices is to be expected in the future and the projected usage trend will be countered by ever-increasing incidence of resistance to herbicides (Beckie and Tardif 2012). Therefore, an efficient and rapid diagnosis of resistance is essential to maintain herbicide efficacy by preventing further resistance selection when resistance has evolved in a weed population and to avoid ineffective herbicide applications.\n\nConclusion\nThe continuous adoption of rice–wheat cropping system in wheat growing regions has led to the problem of Phalaris minor as a troublesome weed of wheat causing yield reductions. Reliable, fast, simple detection of herbicide resistance is necessary for farmers to adopt timely alternative herbicide application strategies to prevent further spread of herbicide-resistant weeds. DNA-based diagnostic markers have the advantage of quickly detecting resistant plants compared with conducting pot assays, which are time and space consuming, and labor intensive. The primary aim of the study was to find the mutations in CT domain of plastidic ACCase gene conferring herbicide resistance in P. minor. The allele-specific PCR marker developed based on SNP will help in identification clodinafop-resistant and susceptible populations.\n\nThe authors acknowledge the financial support for project DWR/RP/10-9.4 by Directorate of Wheat Research, Karnal 132001, India.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nBeckie HJ  Tardif FJ   Herbicide cross resistance in weeds Crop Prot 2012 35 15 28 10.1016/j.cropro.2011.12.018 \nChhokar RS  Malik RK   Isoproturon resistant Phalaris minor  and its response to alternate herbicides Weed Technol 2002 16 116 123 10.1614/0890-037X(2002)016[0116:IRLCPM]2.0.CO;2 \nChhokar RS  Sharma RK   Multiple herbicide resistance in littleseed canarygrass (Phalaris minor ): a threat to wheat production in India Weed Biol Manag 2008 8 112 123 10.1111/j.1445-6664.2008.00283.x \nDélye C  Zhang X-Q  Michel S  Matéjicek A  Powles SB   Molecular basis for sensitivity to acetyl-conzyme A carboxylase inhibitors in black-grass Plant Physiol 2005 137 794 806 10.1104/pp.104.046144 15579665 \nDélye C  Jasieniuk M  Le Corre V   Deciphering the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds Trends Genet 2013 29 649 658 10.1016/j.tig.2013.06.001 23830583 \nDevine MD  Shimabukuro RH   Powles SB  Holtum JAM   Resistance to acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase inhibiting herbicides Herbicide resistance in plants 1994 Boca Raton CRC Press 141 169 \nDoyle JJ  Doyle JL   Isolation of plant DNA from fresh tissue Focus 1990 12 13 15 \nGherekhloo J  Osuna MD  De Prado R   Biochemical and molecular basis of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides in Iranian Phalaris minor  populations Weed Res 2012 52 367 372 10.1111/j.1365-3180.2012.00919.x \nHeap I (2014) 2014 The international survey of herbicide resistant weeds. http://www.weedscience.org.

Phylogenetic analyses identified the Trichoderma isolates as T. harzianum and T. virens. The Trichoderma spp. were found to be antagonistic against the banana leaf pathogens Mycosphaerella musicola, Cordana musae, and Deightoniella torulosa in vitro. Several products used by the banana industry to increase production, including molasses, Fishoil and Seasol, were tested as food source for the Trichoderma isolates. The optimal food substrate was found to be molasses at a concentration of 5 %, which when used in combination with a di-1-p-menthene spreader-sticker enhanced the survivability of Trichoderma populations under natural conditions. This formulation suppressed D. torulosa development under glasshouse conditions. Furthermore, high sensitivity was observed towards the protectant fungicide Mancozeb but Biopest oil®, a paraffinic oil, only marginally suppressed the growth of Trichoderma isolates in vitro. Thus, this protocol represents a potential to manage banana leaf pathogens as a part of an integrated disease approach.\n\nKeywords\nNative Trichoderma spp.AntagonismBiological controlissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nLoss of sensitivity and development of fungicide resistance is becoming a worldwide problem across a range of fungicides and micro organisms (Eckert et al. 1994; Holmes and Eckert 1999; Karaoglanidis et al. 2001; Sholberg and Haag 1993). Currently control of leaf fungal pathogens on bananas (Musa acuminata) in Australia is achieved with the alternation of protectant fungicides, such as Mancozeb, chlorothalonil, paraffinic oils, and systemic fungicides belonging to the strobilurin (QoI) and demethylation inhibiting fungicides (DMI), including the triazoles. The goal of such a strategy is to delay fungicide resistance. However, it has been shown that a shift in sensitivity or appearance of resistant strains occurs within 5 years of commercial introduction of a systemic fungicide (Marín et al. 2003). Such shifts have been documented for all Qo inhibitors including trifloxystrobin, azoxystrobin, famoxadone, strobilurin B and myxothiazol (Chin et al. 2001; Sierotzki et al. 2000), and the triazoles propiconazole (Romero and Sutton 1996) and tebuconazole (Grice and Peterson 2002). Extensive use of benomyl (benzimidazole) by the banana industry worldwide resulted in its withdrawal from control programs (Romero and Sutton 1998; Stover 1977; Stover et al. 1978).\n\nDemand for environmentally safe control measures has promoted the interest in finding non-chemical alternatives, such as biological agents, for the management of fungal pathogens. Most research on biological agents to control banana leaf diseases has been done with bacteria, but with unsatisfactory results under commercial conditions (reviewed by Marín et al. 2003), as this approach requires direct contact with the fungal phytopathogens. Jiménez et al. (1987) evaluated 225 epiphytic populations but with little success as these microorganisms experience difficulties in surviving on the phylloplane. A commercial strain of Bacillus subtilis (in Marín et al. 2003), Serratia marcescens isolates (Miranda 1996), and chitinolytic bacteria (González et al. 1996) evaluated under field conditions did not provide an effective control of banana leaf diseases.\n\nBest results to improve biocontrol of a broad range of phytopathogenic fungi have been achieved with various strains of Trichoderma species (reviewed by Benítez et al. 2004). Schilly et al. (2014) explored 360 bacterial and 143 fungal banana root-associated endophytic microorganisms and found that T. asperellum significantly inhibited the growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, the casual agent of Fusarium wilt of banana, a devastating problem for the banana industry worldwide. Genus Trichoderma possesses antagonistic properties, which are based on the activation of multiple mechanisms, acting synergistically. They affect fungal pathogens either directly by mycoparasitism, or indirectly by competing for nutrients and space, changing the microenvironment, inducing localised or systemic plant defences, acting like plant hormones, boosting plant rooting, and helping improve nutrient uptake (biofertilisation) resulting in increase plant growth (Benítez et al. 2004; Harman et al. 2004). Furthermore, Trichoderma spp. have been found to be highly resistant to a variety of chemical fungicides, toxins and xenobiotic compounds including antibiotics (Harman et al. 1996). Thus they might represent an opportunity to control banana leaf pathogens under commercial conditions.\n\nMost studies have focused on biological agents as alternatives to synthetic fungicides and not as part of an integrated management system (Jacobsen et al. 2004). However, from the research done on biological control of leaf spot diseases (reviewed by Marín et al. 2003), it is evident that application of biological agents might not be sufficient for a successful disease management alone but instead biological agents have to be a part of an integrated management program (Elad et al. 1995; Harman 2000). The combination of biological agents with reduced levels of fungicides promotes a degree of disease suppression similar to that achieved with full fungicide treatment (Elad et al. 1993a, b; Monte 2001) and minimises development of fungicide resistance. Furthermore, locally occurring isolates will normally be more effective than isolates collected from different environment due to environmental adaptation. The aims of this study were (1) to identify Trichoderma strains that survive on leaves of Musa acuminata under wet tropical conditions, (2) to investigate their antagonistic potential against banana leaf fungal pathogens in vivo and in vitro, (3) to develop a strategy that will support the colonisation of banana leaves by Trichoderma populations under natural conditions, and (4) to explore the suitability of incorporating Trichoderma spp. as a biological agent in an integrated management program.\n\nMethods\nFungal isolates and phylogenetic analysis\nThe main banana production area in Australia is the Tully-Innisfail coastal part of North Queensland (NQLD), which experiences high rainfalls (3334.6 mm per year) and tropical temperatures (mean maximum temperature 28.1 °C, and mean minimum temperature 19.2 °C (http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/). Fifty banana diseased leaf and fruit samples were collected from randomly chosen plantations from this region. Fungal isolations were carried out according to Pitt et al. (2010) with small modifications. Briefly, plant tissue with visible disease symptoms were surface sterilised with 70 % ethanol and left to air dry. Tissue sections were cut into pieces of approximately 5–10 mm2 and plated onto 90-mm standard Petri dishes (www.technoplas.com.au) containing Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA; Becton, Dickinson and Company, DifcoTM) amended with 50 μg/mL streptomycin sulphate (Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) after sterilisation. Samples were incubated for 40–48 h at 26 °C in the dark until actively growing mycelium was observed. Morphologically similar cultures were obtained by transferring hyphal tips from actively growing colonies onto fresh PDA plates. Sporulation for each isolate was induced by incubating fungal cultures at 25 ± 1 °C under diurnal light (12 h dark and 12 h near ultraviolet). Fungi were identified on morphological bases (conidial size, shape, and colour) and included Mycosphaerella musicola (yellow Sigatoka), Cordana musae (Cordana leaf spot), and Deightoniella torulosa (Deightoniella leaf spot) (Table 1). Fungal colonies with typical Trichoderma spp. characteristics such as green appearance, fast growth, and concentric green centres surrounded by white mycelium were selected and the genus confirmed microscopically according to Barnet and Hunter (1998). Molecular identification to species level of the Trichoderma isolates was conducted at the Plant Pathology Herbarium (BRIP), Queensland Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry (QDAFF, http://collections.daff.qld.gov.au) based on the rDNA internal transcribed region (ITS; White et al. 1990). Two Trichoderma isolates were identified from a plantation in the Tully region of QLD, and one from the Centre for Wet Tropics Agriculture (CWTA), South Johnstone, QLD (near the town of Innisfail) (Table 1).Table 1 Fungal isolates included in this study\n\nBRIPa\n\tSpecie\tCultivar\tGeographic origin\tDate of isolation\tGenBank Accession Nr.\t\n60169b\n\t\nTrichoderma virens (teleomorph: Hypocrea virens)d\n\tCavendish\tTully valley, QLD\t2013\tKM246885\t\n60170b\n\t\nTrichoderma harzianum (teleomorph: Hypocrea harzianum)d\n\tCavendish\tInnisfail, QLD\t2013\tKM246886\t\n60384c\n\t\nTrichoderma harzianum (teleomorph: Hypocrea harzianum)d\n\tCavendish\tTully valley, QLD\t2014\tKM246887\t\n60375b\n\t\nCordana musae\n\tCavendish\tTully valley, QLD\t2013\t\t\n60374b\n\t\nDeightoniella torulosa\n\tCavendish\tMount Bartle Frere, QLD\t2013\t\t\n\t\nMycosphaerella musicola\n\tCavendish\tSouth Innisfail, QLD\t2014\t\t\n\naPure cultures of single spore isolates are deposited in the QDAFF Biological Collection (QDAFF, http://collections.daff.qld.gov.au)\n\n\nbIsolates were obtained from leaves of banana, Musa acuminata\n\n\n\ncIsolate was obtained from fruit of banana, Musa acuminata\n\n\n\ndIn this article the more common generic name Trichoderma is used over the younger name Hypocrea, the teleomorph of Trichoderma (Chaverri and Samuels 2001; Rossman et al. 2013)\n\n\n\nMultiple sequence alignments and comparisons and contig assembly were performed with DNASTAR (www.dnastar.com). Nucleotide homology search and comparisons of identical sequences were performed with BLAST on publicly available databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Genetic distances were calculated and maximum parsimony trees constructed with MEGA v. 5.0 (Tamura et al. 2007). Nucleotide sequences obtained in this study were deposited at NCBI (Table 1).\n\nIn vitro assessment of antagonistic effect of Trichoderma agents against banana leaf pathogens\nThe Trichoderma isolates obtained in this study were analysed for their ability to suppress banana leaf fungal pathogens in vitro utilising the confrontation technique of Bell et al. (1982). Degrees of antagonism were scored on a scale of classes 1-5 representing different overgrowing capabilities of Trichoderma species as species belonging to classes 1 and 2 are considered to be highly antagonistic to the paired pathogen, class 3 are intermediate antagonists, and classes 4 and 5 are not antagonistic. All fungal cultures were grown on PDA except M. musicola, which was grown on V8 300-medium plates [300 mL V8 vegetable juice, 3 g CaCo3, 15 % Bacto Agar amended with 50 μg/mL streptomycin sulphate (Abadie et al. 2008)]. Comparisons were conducted by pairing 5-mm actively growing mycelium disks of a Trichoderma isolate and a plant pathogen on opposite sides of a Petri dish. Isolates of C.musae were started simultaneously with Trichoderma spp., D. torulosa was placed on agar 48 h before the Trichoderma spp., and M. musicola isolates were grown for 4 weeks until the colonies reached a diameter of approximately 18 mm before Trichoderma spp. were added to the plates.\n\nIn vitro assessment of fungicide sensitivity\nMancozeb in conjunction with Biopest Oil® at 2.5-5 L/ha (Table 2) are the banana industry standards for control of leaf diseases. An in vitro experiment was conducted to investigate the inhibitory effect of Mancozeb alone, Biopest Oil® alone at 2.5 L/ha and 5 L/ha, and Mancozeb with Biopest Oil® on the Trichoderma isolates identified in this study. The concentrations tested were in accordance to the dosage of application recommended by the manufacturers. Amended plates were prepared by adding sterifiltrated fungicide chemicals to melted and warm PDA at 50 °C before pouring the media into plates (Mondal et al. 2005; Samuelian et al. 2012). The centre of each plate was inoculated with a 5-mm agar plug of mycelium obtained from the edge of an actively growing PDA culture, with 6 replicates per treatment. Plates were maintained at 25 ± 1 °C under diurnal light to enhance sporulation. Simultaneous measurements were taken for all treatments and each individual fungal isolate when the growth of the no-fungicide control covered 80–90 % of the plates. The colony diameter was measured across two perpendicular axes. The response variable was the ratio of the average of the diameters for each treatment in comparison to the control (no-fungicide) treatment within the same isolate, set and replicate. This quantified the inhibition in fungal growth for each treatment in comparison to the control. Conidia were enumerated with a haemocytometer as previously described (Samuelian et al. 2014) as three counts were carried out for each replicate. Results were expressed as percentage growth compared to cultures grown on the no-fungicide control. The experiment was conducted twice.Table 2 Formulation, rate of application and origin of the fungicides used in this study\n\nCommon name\tFormulationa\n\tApplication rate (ai/ha)b\n\tProduct name\tSupplier\t\nMancozeb\t750 g/L, w.p.\t1650 g\tPenncozeb 750 DF\tNufarm\t\nParaffinic oil\tl.\t2.5–5 L\tBiopest oil®\n\tSacoa\t\nFishoil\tl.\t8 L\tFishoil\tEarth care\t\nSeasol\tl.\t4 L\tSeasol\tEarth care\t\ndi-1-p-menthene\tl.\t600 mL\tNuFilm-17\tAgspec\t\ndi-1-p-menthene\tl.\t600 mL\tFleXstic\tAgritec\t\n\naType of formulation: l.—liquid; w.p.—wettable powder\n\n\nbStandard fungicide application dosage with ground equipment recommended by manufacturers is 250 L/ha\n\n\n\nIn vitro assessment of best formulations of food substrate and other adjuvants\nThe Australian Banana Industry utilises stockfeed molasses at 5–20 %, Seasol at a rate of 0.75–3 % and Fishoil at a rate of 1.5–6 % (Table 2) in the belief that these products could boost plant health and yield, and reduce the incidences of leaf diseases (based on a survey conducted by Samuelian 2014). Therefore, molasses in concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 %, Seasol in concentrations of 0.75, 1.5 and 3 %, and Fishoil in concentrations of 1.5, 3 and 6 % were tested as potential food sources for growth of T. virens and T. harzianum in vitro. Growth media consisted of the relevant concentrations of each food source in 15 % Bacto Agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Difco™). Furthermore, two plant derived adjuvants (wetting agents) were compared for their suitability to be used as spreader-stickers. These were NuFilm-17 and FleXstic at 2.4 μL/mL of PDA (Table 2). Measurements for all treatments were performed as described in 2.4.\n\nSurvivability of Trichoderma spp. with a food substrate and a wetting agent under field conditions\nEstablishment and persistence of Trichoderma spp. populations on banana leaves was studied under field conditions at the CWTA (mean temperature 23.7 °C, 3334.6 mm year−1 rainfall, 136 days of rain ≥1 mm; soil: reddish brown light clay (Heiner and Smith 1987); 17.3 m elevation). The trial was conducted on bananas Musa (AAA, Cavendish subgroup) cv. ‘Williams’ irrigated by mini-sprinklers. The fertiliser program for the experiment consisted of biweekly applications of potassium nitrate (19.3 % N, 0 % P and 28.4 % K) at the rate of 35.7 kg/ha and biweekly applications of urea (15.7 kg/ha) through the mini-sprinkler irrigation system. No fungicides were applied during the experiment. Trichoderma isolates were cultured on PDA plates as already described under section ‘Fungal isolates and phylogenetic analysis’. Conidia collection and enumeration was conducted as described under section ‘Biological control of Deightoniella torulosa with Trichoderma spp. in vivo’ to a final concentration of 106 spores/mL for each isolate. Treatments included Trichoderma spp., mixed in equal proportions, in water; Trichoderma spp. in 5 % molasses; and Trichoderma spp. in 5 % molasses and NuFilm-17 at 2.4 μL/mL. Each treatment was applied on two leaves of an individual plant on both the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) surfaces of the leaves with a hand-held 500 mL spray bottle until runoff. Each treatment was replicated 4 times. Control consisted of leaves treated with water alone. Confirmation of the presence of Trichoderma populations was conducted by removing two 5–10 mm2 leaf sections from each leaf with a sterile scalpel blade every 48 h and culturing the leaf segments on PDA as described under section ‘Fungal isolates and phylogenetic analysis’. Evaluation of Trichoderma spp. was based on morphological characterisation where ‘0’ represented lack of observation of Trichoderma development and ‘1’ represented fungal growth. Presence of Trichoderma populations for each treatment was calculated as the sum of presence or absence of Trichoderma populations in the samples analysed divided by the number of samples (n = 8) and multiplied by 100 to represent the results as percentile revived Trichoderma populations. The experiment commenced at the end of March 2014 and was concluded at the end of April 2014. A second experiment was conducted in March–April 2015.\n\nBiological control of Deightoniella torulosa with Trichoderma spp. in vivo\nA pilot study performed with the banana leaf pathogens analysed in this study determined that the most aggressive pathogen on leaves of young plants was D. torulosa causing the death of the infected plants within 2 weeks of infection (data not shown). Therefore, the potential of Trichoderma sp. to suppress D. torulosa using the protocol developed in this study was tested under glasshouse conditions. Tissue-cultured plants were potted on a potting mix (New Zealand peat: medium grade sand: coarse horticultural grade perlite 2:1:1; 2 g/L Growforce 101 fertiliser; 2 g/L Superphosphate; 4 g/L Dolomite) and grown in a humidity chamber at 26 °C for 14 days. Plants were further placed in a completely randomised design on a glasshouse bench and grown at ambient temperature 18–31 °C for 1 week. Plants were irrigated with overhead sprinklers. Infection of plants with conidia and fungal vegetative parts was conducted according to Alvindia (2012) with small modifications. One-month-old culture of D. torulosa grown on PDA was flooded with 20 mL sterile distilled water. Fungal colony was lightly scraped with a sterile Pasteur glass pipette to harvest fungal conidia and mycelium. The resulting suspension, containing 300 conidia/mL (determined as described under section “In vitro assessment of best formulations of food substrate and other adjuvants”), was transferred to a glass beaker and lightly mixed with a glass rod. The suspension was delivered to young banana plantlets with a pure bristle 38 mm paint brush until runoff as both the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the leaves were treated. Banana plants were covered with black plastic bags for 48 h to stimulate pathogen infection. Treatments included D. torulosa alone, D. torulosa with 5 % molasses and NuFilm-17 at 2.4 μL/mL, and D. torulosa with co-application with Trichoderma spp. combined with 5 % molasses and NuFilm-17 at 2.4 μL/mL. Control plants were treated with water. Visible lesions were assessed 72 h post infection and a modified disease severity index (DSI; Stover and Dickson 1970) = [(Sum nb)/(N − 1) × T], was calculated, where n = number of leaves in each grade, b = grade, N = number of grades used (total of 4 as ‘0’ represents a leaf without symptoms, ‘1’—symptoms observed on 25 % of the leaf; ‘2’—symptoms observed on 50 % of the leaf; ‘3’—symptoms observed on 75 % of the leaf; and ‘4’—symptoms observed on 100 % of the leaf), and T = total number of leaves graded on each plant. Confirmation of infection was conducted by plating leaf areas with symptoms on PDA and the developed specie determined based on morphological and cultural characteristics. The experiment was conducted twice.\n\nStatistical analyses\nANOVA techniques were used to quantify statistical differences between treatments using Statistix 8 (Analytical Software: www.statistix.com). Tukey’s LSD all pairwise comparisons test was used for comparison of means at P = 0.05.\n\nResults\nIsolation and identification of Trichoderma spp.\nBased on phylogenetic/molecular analyses of the ITS1 conserved region of Trichoderma spp. (Fig. 1) the isolate BRIP60169 was identified as Trichoderma (Hypocrea) virens, and BRIP60170 and BRIP60384 as Trichoderma (Hypocrea) harzianum (Table 1).Fig. 1 Phylogenetic relationship between Trichoderma isolates obtained during this study. Consensus tree was inferred using the neighbour-joining method. Sequences available at public databases were incorporated in the analyses. Numbers at nodes represent 1000 bootstrap replications. Only values above 70 % are indicated. The tree was rooted to Ceratocystis paradoxa. Scale bar represents genetic distances. NCBI accession numbers are presented in brackets\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro antagonism of Trichoderma spp. against banana leaf pathogens\nMeasured by the degree of coverage, BRIP60169 was the least antagonistic organism against C. musae and D. torulosa compared to BRIP60170 and BRIP60384 (Table 3). BRIP60170 and BRIP60384 displayed the same degree of coverage of all fungal pathogens studied. No difference between the antagonistic abilities of all Trichoderma isolates against Mycosphaerella musicola was observed.Table 3 Coverage degrees of Trichoderma isolates against banana leaf pathogens using the confrontation technique in vitro on PDA plates incubated at 26 °C for 7 days\n\nFungal pathogen\t\nTrichoderma isolate\t\nBRIP60169\tBRIP60170\tBRIP60384\t\n\nCordana musae\n\t3\t2\t2\t\n\nDeightoniella torulosa\n\t2\t1\t1\t\n\nMycosphaerella musicola\n\t1\t1\t1\t\n\nNigrospora sp.\n\t1.5\t1\t1\t\n‘1’—Trichoderma completely overgrows the pathogen and covers the entire medium surface; ‘2’—Trichoderma overgrows two-thirds of the pathogen; ‘3’—Trichoderma overgrows half of the pathogen\n\n\n\nAssessment of fungicide sensitivity\nMancozeb and Mancozeb combined with Biopest Oil® at 2.5 and 5 L/ha completely inhibited mycelium growth of all Trichoderma isolates analysed. Biopest Oil® at 2.5 L/ha suppressed vegetative growth of the Trichoderma isolates by approximately 35 % (Fig. 2a). The same was observed for Biopest Oil® at 5 L/ha for BRIP60170 and BRIP60384 but the growth rate of BRIP60169 was slower by 46 % compared to the isolate’s development on PDA. Biopest Oil® at 2.5 L/ha reduced the number of spores of BRIP60170 and BRIP60384 by 69 and 74 %, respectively, when compared to their sporulation on PDA and of BRIP60169 by 84 % (Fig. 2b). Sporulation for all isolates on Biopest Oil® at 5 L/ha was lower than for 2.5 L/ha. BRIP60169 produced the smallest number of spores on Biopest Oil® at 5 L/ha.Fig. 2 In vitro vegetative (a) and sporulation (b) sensitivity of Trichoderma virens (BRIP60169), and T. harzianum (BRIP60170 and BRIP60384) to Biopest oil at 2.5 L/ha (white square) and 5 L/ha (grey square) (Table 2).

Growth was not observed on any of the concentrations of Fishoil. Mycelium growth for all Trichoderma isolates was equal or even faster at 5 % molasses compared to fungal development on PDA (Fig. 3). 10 and 20 % molasses was less favourable food source for the Trichoderma isolates compared to 5 % molasses. It was found that NuFilm-17 was less inhibitory for all Trichoderma spp. compared to FleXstic (Fig. 4).Fig. 3 In vitro sensitivity of Trichoderma virens (BRIP60169), and T.\nharzianum (BRIP60170 and BRIP60384) to 5 % (white square), 10 % (grey square), and 20 % (black square) Molasses.

Results are presented in relation to fungal development on potato dextrose agar. Error bars indicate standard error. Bars with a different letter are significantly different according to Tukey’s LSD all-pairwise comparisons test at a 5 % similarity confidence level\n\n\n\nSurvivability of Trichoderma spp. under field conditions\nBased on the fungicide sensitivity, antagonistic properties and growth rate of the three Trichoderma spp., and development on a food substrate and a spreader-sticker, it was decided to study the potential of BRIP60170 and BRIP60384 in combination with 5 % molasses and NuFilm-17 at 2.4 μL/mL to colonise banana leaves under natural conditions. Trichoderma spp. applied with 5 % molasses and NuFilm-17 were fully recovered during the course of the trial (Fig. 5). A decline in the Trichoderma spp. colonisation was observed after the sixth day of introduction of the organisms with water alone and after the twelfth day with 5 % molasses on banana plants under natural conditions. Subsequently Trichoderma spp. colonisation deteriorated for both treatments and dropped down to 56 % and 72 % for the Trichoderma spp. with water and Trichoderma spp. with 5 % molasses, respectively, after 28 days of application. During that period the total amount of rainfall received at the experimental site was 361.3 mm (http://www.bom.gov.au) with the highest amount of 160.2 mm received on the sixteenth day after the initiation of the experiment.Fig. 5 Survivability of Trichoderma spp. on banana leaves under natural conditions with a food substrate and a spreader-sticker.

Error bars represent standard deviations\n\n\n\nBiological control of banana leaf diseases in vivo\nThe ability of Trichoderma spp. to suppress the banana fungal leaf pathogen D. torulosa was tested under greenhouse conditions. It was observed that the two Trichoderma isolates BRIP60170 and BRIP60384 combined with 5 % molasses and NuFilm-17 significantly inhibited the development of D. torulosa (Table 4) to levels similar to the untreated control.Table 4 Effect of Trichoderma spp. on Deightoniella torulosa development following assessment of disease severity index 72 h after infection\n\nTreatment\tDisease Severity Index\t\n\nD. torulosa\n\t35.6 a\t\n\nD. torulosa with 5 % molasses and NuFilm-17\t28.9 a\t\nCo-application with Trichoderma spp. with 5 % molasses and NuFilm-17\t4.4 b\t\nControl, no fungal infection\t0 b\t\nDifferent letters indicate significantly different values according to Tukey’s LSD all-pairwise comparisons test at a 5 % similarity confidence level\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nDemand for sustainability in food production is becoming a mega trend amongst consumers. Customers expect safer and ‘sustainable food’, which is acknowledged through tougher regulations and registrations of synthetic products. Fast urbanisation of areas in close vicinity to agricultural plantations limits the use of aerial chemical spraying thus constraining their use and increasing the price of application. Heavy reliance on small molecule systemic chemicals and their overuse can give rise to rapid build-up of resistance leading to loss of effective control as it has happened in many horticultural industries. Currently, there is an increased interest in the reduction of chemical residues and prevention of resistance development through utilisation of biological products particularly Trichoderma spp. which are believed to present the highest potential as a commercial biofungicides around the world (Harman 2006; Harman et al. 2004; Lorito et al. 2010; Mukherjee et al. 2014).\n\nMost of the research conducted has investigated the potential of biological agents alone and little attention has been given to the development of integrated approaches as alternatives for systemic chemicals for the control of banana leaf pathogens. The advantages of such a strategy will translate into reduced disease pressure, fewer fungicide applications, reduced risks of resistance to fungicides in the pathogen population and enhanced environmental benefits. However, use of biological control of banana leaf diseases is challenging because of the polycyclic development of the crop, unfurling of young leaves every 6–12 days, and the presence of plants of different ages in the plantations. In addition, biological agents are influenced by the environment and have to compete with other organisms to survive. Therefore, in this study we investigated the potential of Trichoderma spp. as a part of a holistic approach to control the growth of banana leaf fungal pathogens in combination with non-chemical products such as a food source and a spreader-sticker and a ‘softer’ chemical product.\n\nThis study collated data needed for further advances in developing an integrated approach for a sustainable and environmentally friendly innovations in banana leaf disease protection. Antagonism of Trichoderma spp. against banana leaf pathogens, fungicide sensitivity, food formulation and adjuvant, and survivability under natural conditions were investigated. The results show that both T.harzianum and T. virens were effective in controlling banana leaf pathogens in vitro. The striking feature of T. harzianum is its rapid growth which enabled it to overgrow Deightoniella torulosa, Cordana musae and Mycosphaerella musicola within a week of dual incubation with a pathogen. Similar strong antagonistic abilities were reported for T. harzianum in controlling banana fungal pathogens (Alvindia 2013; Alvindia and Hirooka 2011; Alvindia and Natsuaki 2008).\n\nSuccess of an integrated control depends on the survivability and compatibility of biological agents with all the products used in a management program which could be accomplished by alternation with a softer chemical. A level of control similar to that obtained with standard fungicides was achieved for Botrytis cinerea control when T. harzianum was alternated with dicarboximide fungicides (Elad et al. 1993a, b). Petroleum-derived mineral spray oil programs have been used by the banana industry worldwide since the 1950s. Oil retards initial fungal infection and development and enhances fungicide performance (Beattie et al. 2002). There has been a concern that accumulation of oil might cause phytotoxicity, which is enhanced by environmental conditions, especially at temperatures over 32 °C and high humidity. However, phytotoxicity has been associated with older mineral formulations while the possibility of photodegradation has been strongly reduced with the current highly refined oils. Biopest oil® has been available for many years for Sigatoka control and is currently registered in Australia and routinely used along with Mancozeb for the control of yellow Sigatoka. In this study Biopest oil® suppressed Trichoderma spp. in vitro, but did not completely inhibit their growth as Mancozeb. Therefore, a combination of biocontrol preparation with Biopest oil® might be a feasible alternative towards reducing levels of fungicide residues and adding advantage for commercial application.\n\nSurvival of Trichoderma populations on the phylloplane is a key factor for achieving effective control (Elad et al. 1993a, b). McKenzie et al. (1991) speculated that poor effectiveness to suppress grey mould under field conditions could be explained by poor survival of the biological agent on the phylloplane. Food sources are used for mass production of Trichoderma spp. which afterwards are delivered as dried formulations (Thangavelu et al. 2004; Mukherjee et al. 2014). In the present study, an innovative approach to enhance the survivability and persistence of Trichoderma populations in the field through the addition of a food source and an adjuvant was investigated. NuFilm-17 is a surfactant spreader-sticker that was also reported to provide ultraviolet protection of entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana against the boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis (Wright and Chandler 1992). NuFilm-17 is recommended for use with Sentinel, a Trichoderma spp. based biological control product supplied by Agrimm (http://www.agrimm.co.nz/) with the potential to protect grapevines against Botrytis cinerea. Arthurs and Lacey (2004) used NuFilm-17 spreader-sticker in all treatments during a field evaluation of commercial formulations of the coding moth granulovirus against natural infestations of codling moth in Pacific Northwest apple orchards even though the authors did not elaborate on the reasons behind this decision. Elad et al. (1993b) reported a delay in Botrytis cinerea development on ruscus when high rates of NuFilm-17 were applied. In this study a slight decline in Trichoderma spp. mycelium growth was observed when fungi were grown on di-1-p-menthene in vitro, which did not seem to have a negative effect on the Trichoderma spp. colonisation under natural conditions. The adjuvant also prevented a decline in the Trichoderma spp. populations compared to what happened with Trichoderma spp. alone and Trichoderma spp. with a food source, especially after the high amount of rainfall on the sixteenth day after the biological agents were introduced in the field.\n\nCommercial success of Trichoderma biofungicides would depend on identification of native strains adapted to local conditions. Furthermore, development of an integrated approach that incorporates such Trichoderma spp. with a soft chemical product may present a feasible option for the control of leaf diseases on banana as well as on other horticultural crops. This study has demonstrated the advantage of adding a food substrate and an adjuvant to Trichoderma spp. to effectively colonise banana phyllosphere for a prolonged period of time. Furthermore, it was shown that Trichoderma spp. are effective in controlling banana fungal pathogens under controlled conditions. The next logical step should be to elucidate the potential of this system under commercial conditions.\n\nThis work was conducted within the Banana Plant Protection Program BA10020—a joint initiative of the Queensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (QDAFF) and the University of Queensland (UQ).

Urban), in cells elicited with salicylic acid (50–200 µM). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot analysis indicated CaSQS, CabAS, and CaCYS genes expressed in both the wild-type and cultured cells (with and without elicitation). In elicited cells, expressions of CaSQS, CabAS, and CaCYS genes showed strong dependence on salicylic acid concentration and elicitation day. The highest expression of CabAS gene was found in the cells elicited with 100 µM salicylic acid on day 10 of inoculation. Salicylic acid treatment (50–200 µM) decreased expression level of CaCYS and CaSQS genes in elicited cells compared with the control.\n\nKeywords\nCabASCaCYSCaSQSCentella asiaticaCentellosideElicitorSalicylic acidNational Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), Vietnam106.16-2012.80Loc Nguyen Hoang issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nCentella (Centella asiatica (L.) Urban) is a perennial, faintly aromatic and a valuable medicinal herb. It is widely distributed throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Seevaratnam et al. 2012). Centella has been used as a traditional herbal medicine in many Asian countries for hundreds of years (Brinkhaus et al. 2000).\n\nTriterpene saponins are a class of plant secondary metabolites with structure derived from the precursor oxidosqualene in which one or more sugar residues are added (Yendo et al. 2010). Triterpene saponins in centella mainly include centellosides (asiaticoside, asiatic acid, madecassoside and madecassic acid) (Bylka et al. 2013). Extract of centella contains centellosides that can elevate antioxidant level in healing wounds, increasing fibroblast production, collagen formation and angiogenesis (Li et al. 2007; Shukla et al. 1999; Maquart et al. 1999). These components are also known to be clinically effective on systemic scleroderma, abnormal scar formation, and keloids (Hong et al. 2005). Although the centellosides have many important pharmaceutical properties, their content is not significant in plant, thus it is difficult to scale up production. Plant cell cultures were, therefore, widely used as a convenient tool to provide a valuable alternative for the production of important secondary metabolites for commercial interest.\n\nThere were some reports on the biosynthesis of centellosides and phytosterol from in vitro cultures of centella. These studies investigated into the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), as an elicitor, in relation to expression levels of genes that participate in triterpene metabolism (isoprenoid pathway) in cultured centella cells such as CaSQS (Centella asiatica squalene synthase), CabAS (C. asiatica β-amyrin synthase), and CaCYS (C. asiatica cycloartenol synthase) (Fig. 1) (Kim et al. 2005a, b, c, 2009; Mangas et al. 2008). CaSQS and CabAS are two genes that produce large quantities of triterpene saponins such as asiaticoside and madecassoside, in which CaSQS is considered a key regulator gene. CaCYS gene codes cycloartenol synthase, the enzyme responsible for the first step in sterol biosynthesis (Mangas et al. 2006).Fig. 1 Isoprenoid pathway in biosynthesis of phytosterol and triterpenoid in centella (Kim et al. 2005a, b, c, 2009; Mangas et al. 2008). FPS farnesyl diphosphate synthase, SE squalene epoxidase, OSC oxidosqualene cyclase\n\n\n\nAccording to Jirage et al. (1999), salicylic acid is an important signal molecule, it activate genes related to plant protection against pathogenesis. When used as an elicitor, salicylic acid is very useful for the accumulation of the bioactive compounds relate to pathogenesis. However, there was no report on the effect of salicylic acid on the biosynthesis of centellosides, and the relationship between salicylic acid elicitation and metabolic genes in cultured cells. While this research direction was performed in some other plant species, for example Yu et al. (2006) found the relationship between expression levels of chs (chalcone synthase) and chi (chalcone isomerase) genes with contents of jaceosidin and syringin in Saussurea medusa cells treated with salicylic acid. Yousefzadi et al. (2010) found salicylic acid elicitation increased expression levels of the genes coding for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase and cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in the first steps of podophyllotoxin pathway in Linum album. However, expression of the pinoresinol–lariciresinol reductase gene, which is involved in one of the last biosynthetic steps, was not affected by salicylic acid.\n\nOur previous studies have demonstrated that an optimal concentration of salicylic acid (100 µM) can stimulate asiaticoside production, a major component of centelloside, in centella cells up to 229.83 mg/g dry weight, while an optimal concentration of MeJA (100 µM) or yeast extract (4 g/L) only enhances asiaticoside production to 205.92 or 165.41 mg/g dry weight, respectively (Loc and Giang 2012; Giang et al. 2015). So the present work was setup based on this idea to find the molecular mechanism of gene regulation under the influence of salicylic acid. The results may provide us with a clearer understanding of problems related to salicylic acid elicitation to improve the productivity of the centelloside biosynthesis in cultured cells of centella. The effect of salicylic acid on gene regulation in the isoprenoid pathway can be applied to control the biotechnological production of centelloside.\n\nMaterials and methods\nPlant materials\nCentella suspension cells were cultured as our previous report (Loc and Giang 2012). Three grams of cells were inoculated in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL of nutrient medium and incubated at 25 ± 2 °C on the rotary shaker with a speed of 120 rpm for 24 days under an intensity of 360 lux to produce biomass.\n\nElicitation effect of salicylic acid was studied by adding different concentrations (50–200 μM) to the medium at the beginning of cell culture, and days 5, 10 and 15 after inoculation. The cell biomass was harvested after 24 days by filtration, expression level of CaSQS, CabAS and CaCYS genes was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot.\n\ncDNA synthesis and preparation of probe\nTotal RNA was isolated from centella 14-day-old cells using the Invitrap® Spin Plant RNA Mini Kit (Stratec Molecular GmbH, Berlin, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nFirst strand cDNA was synthesized by the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (#K1612, Fermentas) in a final volume of 20 µL with 5 µg of total RNA, 0.5 µg of oligo(dT)18 primer, 4 µL of 5× reaction buffer, 20 unit of RiboLockTM ribonuclease inhibitor, 2 µL of 10 mM dNTP mix and 40 units of M-MuLV (Moloney-murine leukemia virus) reverse transcriptase. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, stopped at 70 °C for 5 min and kept at 4 °C in ice bath.\n\nThe probes for CaSQS, CabAS and CaCYS were described by Bonfill et al. (2011). The primer sequences corresponding to the probes are listed in Table 1. The PCR amplifications for probes were performed in a thermal cycler (MyCyclerTM, Bio-Rad, USA) using PCR master mix (#M7502 Promega, Madison, USA). The PCR mixture consisted of 125 ng cDNA, 6 µL of 2× master mix, 10 pmol of each primer, and double distilled water to a final volume of 12 µL. All the PCRs were carried out under the following conditions: genomic denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR amplicons were then purified and inserted into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, USA) and transformed into E. coli TOP10 cells. The nucleotide sequence of the insert was confirmed by the method of fluorescent dideoxy-terminator on 3130 ABI system (Applied Biosystem).Table 1 Oligonucleotide primers used in the PCR amplification for the probes of CaSQS, CaCYS and CabAS genes (Bonfill et al. 2011)\n\nNo.\tPrimers\tNucleotide sequences\t\n1\tCaSQS-F\t5′-TGGGTTAGGGTTGTCAAAGC-3′\t\nCaSQS-R\t5′-CGGAAGATAGCAGGATCTCG-3′\t\n2\tCabAS-F\t5′-TGGTTGGGGAGAAAGTCTTG-3′\t\nCabAS-R\t5′-ACAAGCGTTTGCGGTACTCT-3′\t\n3\tCaCYS-F\t5′-GAATCCACGCCATGAAGTCT-3′\t\nCaCYS-R\t5′-ACCACCATGATCCAGAATCC-3′\t\n\n\nRT-PCR\nThe expression levels of CaSQS, CabAS and CaCYS genes in centella cells elicited with salicylic acid were determined by RT-PCR. The PCR amplification was carried out as described above. The intensities of PCR products were calculated using Quantity One program (ver. 4.1) of Gel Documentation System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\nNorthern blot\nThe probes of interested genes were labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP using DIG High Prime DNA Labelling and Detection Starter Kit I (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nForty micrograms total RNA was size-fractionated by 1.2 % (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and then transferred to a Hybond-N+ (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) nylon membrane. The blots were hybridized with cDNA probes of interested genes (CaSQS, CabAS and CaCYS) labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP at 42 °C overnight. After hybridization, blots were washed and incubated with antibody-conjugated digoxigenin and alkaline phosphatase (1:5000 v/v) at room temperature for 30 min. The 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP)/nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) substrate is used for color development. The intensities of hybridization signals were analyzed using Quantity One program (ver. 4.1) of Gel Documentation System.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe experiments were done in triplicate. The data were analyzed as means followed by one-way ANOVA (Duncan’s test, p < 0.05).\n\nResults\nExpression of CaSQS gene\nIn this study, we investigated CaSQS gene expression in cell cultures treated with salicylic acid through the transcription using both the RT-PCR and the Northern blot techniques.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2a, CaSQS gene expression was higher in the wild-type leaf and the non-elicited cells than in the elicited cells. Transcript levels of the CaSQS gene in elicited cells decreased with increasing salicylic acid concentration or elicitation day, and it seems to be depressed at salicylic concentration of 200 µM during all elicitation times (0–15 days). Similarly, Northern blot analysis revealed stronger hybridization signals in the wild-type and non-elicited cells compared with that in elicited cells (Fig. 3a).Fig. 2 RT-PCR of CaSQS (a), CabAS (b) and CaCYS (c) genes from centella cell cultures.

Northern blot analysis was carried out as described in materials and methods section. Images were analyzed using Quantity One program (ver. 4.1) of Gel Documentation System\n\n\n\nIntensities of DNA bands from RT-PCR and in situ hybridization signals showed they ranged from 401 to 2895 and 443 to 2120, respectively. The highest was found in non-elicited cells at the beginning of culture. A short elicitation time with lower concentration of salicylic acid did not significantly inhibit CaSQS gene expression (Table 2).Table 2 Intensities of DNA bands from RT-PCR and in situ hybridization signals from Northern blot of CaSQS, CabAS and CaCYS genes in centella cells\n\nGene\tMethod\tSamples\t\n1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t7\t8\t9\t10\t11\t12\t13\t14\t15\t16\t17\t18\t19\t\n\nCaSQS\n\tRT-PCR\t2095c\n\t2895a\n\t2672b\n\t1634e\n\t1540f\n\t1801d\n\t2043c\n\t1556f\n\t1737de\n\t1696de\n\t1843d\n\t1150h\n\t1339g\n\t1189h\n\t1659e\n\t401k\n\t544j\n\t949i\n\t1096h\n\t\nNB\t1872c\n\t2120a\n\t1998b\n\t1001f\n\t1214e\n\t1262e\n\t1441d\n\t994f\n\t1002f\n\t1201e\n\t1220e\n\t845g\n\t878fg\n\t905fg\n\t990f\n\t443j\n\t689h\n\t709h\n\t723h\n\t\n\nCabAS\n\tRT-PCR\t1200j\n\t1432i\n\t1986g\n\t2256f\n\t2592ce\n\t2695c\n\t2535e\n\t2702c\n\t3001b\n\t4012a\n\t2462e\n\t1910g\n\t2259f\n\t1848gh\n\t1725h\n\t543l\n\t501l\n\t851k\n\t878k\n\t\nNB\t891fg\n\t1003f\n\t2013d\n\t2120d\n\t2443c\n\t1578e\n\t2461c\n\t2500c\n\t2771b\n\t2942a\n\t2758b\n\t1891e\n\t2002d\n\t2022d\n\t993f\n\t443h\n\t443h\n\t877fg\n\t881fg\n\t\n\nCaCYS\n\tRT-PCR\t2557a\n\t2312b\n\t2287b\n\t2077d\n\t2180c\n\t1749e\n\t1563f\n\t1320g\n\t1001\t1100h\n\t711j\n\t843ij\n\t1100h\n\t1039h\n\t903i\n\t250j\n\t340k\n\t320k\n\t289k\n\t\nNB\t2696a\n\t2356b\n\t2122c\n\t2005d\n\t1987d\n\t1673g\n\t1886de\n\t1921de\n\t1890de\n\t1802f\n\t1920de\n\t2117c\n\t2011d\n\t1935de\n\t2000d\n\t657j\n\t1322i\n\t1557h\n\t498k\n\t\nDifferent letters in a row indicate significantly different means (Duncan’s test, p < 0.05)\n\nRT-PCR and Northern blot analysis data were recorded and analyzed using Quantity One program (ver. 4.1) of Gel Documentation System\n\n\nNB Northern blot, 1 wild-type centella leaf, 2 centella cells at the beginning of culture, 3 centella cells after 24 days of culture, 4–7 centella cells treated with 50 µM salicylic acid at the days 0, 5, 10, and 15 after inoculation, respectively, 8–11 centella cells treated with 100 µM salicylic acid at the days 0, 5, 10, and 15 after inoculation, respectively, 12–15 centella cells treated with 150 µM salicylic acid at the days 0, 5, 10, and 15 after inoculation, respectively, 16–19 centella cells treated with 200 µM salicylic acid at the days 0, 5, 10, and 15 after inoculation, respectively\n\n\n\nExpression of CabAS gene\nWe also analyzed CabAS gene expression (coding β-amyrin synthase, the specific oxidosqualene cyclase for centelloside production) in triterpene metabolism of centella cells. RT-PCR results showed CabAS gene expression was higher in the elicited cells (100 μM salicylic acid) than in the controls (wild-type and non-elicited cells). The highest levels were achieved on day 10 of inoculation, approximately 3.3- and 2.8-fold higher than the controls, respectively (Fig. 2b; Table 2).\n\nNorthern blot analysis also indicated that the cells treated with 100 µM salicylic acid on 10th day of inoculation resulted in the strongest expression of CabAS gene (Fig. 3b), the intensity values ranged from 2500 to 2942, approximately 3.3- and 2.9-fold higher than the controls, respectively (Table 2). These results are in accordance with RT-PCR analysis. Expression of CabAS gene obviously decreased in the cells treated with higher concentrations (150–200 μM) of salicylic acid.\n\nExpression of CaCYS gene\nThe effect of salicylic acid elicitation on the expression of CaCYS gene was investigated. The RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis indicated that CaCYS strongly expressed in the wild-type and non-elicited cells (Figs. 2c, 3c). All concentrations of salicylic acid (50–200 µM) strongly inhibited CaCYS gene expression.\n\nIntensity values of RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis ranged from 103 to 2557 and 496 to 2696, respectively. In general, CaCYS gene expression in centella cell cultures (with and without elicitation) was weaker than that in the wild type.\n\nSalicylic acid treatment of 100 µM on day 10 of inoculation strongly affected the expression of CaCYS gene. The RT-PCR analysis showed that transcription level reduced by 2.5 times compared to the wild type (Figs. 2c, 3c). Similar to the expression of CaSQS and CabAS genes, centella cells treated with 200 µM salicylic acid also inhibited CaCYS gene (Table 2).\n\nDiscussion\nCaSQS, CabAS, and CaCYS genes play important roles in the biosynthesis of phytosterols and triterpenoid in centella. CabAS is a key gene for triterpenoid regulation, whereas CaCYS gene responds for phytosterols synthesis (Hernandez-Vazquez et al. 2010). In previous report, we showed that salicylic acid elicitation enhanced asiaticoside accumulation, a type of triterpenoid, especially at concentration of 100 µM (Loc and Giang 2012). In present work, we have studied the expression of genes relating to the centelloside biosynthesis under elicitation of salicylic acid (50–200 µM). Our results showed salicylic acid inhibited the expression of CaSQS and CaCYS genes, while increased the transcription of CabAS gene (Fig. 2). Kim et al. (2005b) demonstrated that the expression of CabAS in centella leaves was increased along with the accumulation of asiaticoside when elicited by 100 µM MeJA.\n\nThen they also found positive effect of MeJA on the mRNA transcription of bAS and saikosaponin production in another plant species, Bupleurum falcatum (Kim et al. 2011). Similarly, we found the relation between CabAS expression and asiaticoside production in centella cells treated with salicylic acid. Salicylic acid elicitation (50–150 µM) increased the mRNA transcription of CabAS in comparison with the wild type.\n\nIn centella cells, triterpene saponins and phytosterols are converted from precursor 2,3-oxidosqualene through two different pathways. The occurrence of these pathways is dependent on the activities of enzymes encoded by CabAS and CaCYS genes, respectively. Thus, the metabolic pathway relates to the expression levels of corresponding genes.\n\nKim et al. (2005c) reported that centella cells treated with MeJA inhibited the transcription of CaCYS while stimulating the synthesis of CabAS mRNA along with enhancing asiaticoside production. Mangas et al. (2008) have determined the centelloside content of calli grown in different culture media and analyzed the expression levels of some genes in the centelloside biosynthetic pathway. The results showed a low expression of the gene encoding β-amyrin synthase, and its centelloside content was <0.9 mg/g dry weight, while in the wild-type centella plants the centelloside content was from 1.5 to 2 mg/g dry weight.\n\nIn previous report, we found salicylic acid stimulated asiaticoside production (Loc and Giang 2012). This result is in accordance with the increasing expression level of CabAS as well as decreasing synthesis of CaCYS mRNA in present study (Fig. 2). Our results also confirmed that asiaticoside production is tightly regulated by the expression of both CabAS and CaCYS genes. Interestingly, the expression of CaSQS gene was inhibited by salicylic acid elicitation at concentrations from 50 to 200 µM. In contrast, Kim et al. (2005a) showed that CaSQS expression in centella cells was enhanced when MeJA is added to the culture medium. This observation is also found in Medicago truncatula (Suzuki et al. 2002), and Glycyrrhiza glabra (Hayashi et al. 1999). However, these studies were not performed in cell cultures. Thus, it seems that the regulation of CaSQS gene under elicitation of salicylic acid in centella cells differs from the wild type.\n\nIn other plant species such as Linum album, (Yousefzadi et al. 2010) found the cells treated with 10 μM salicylic acid for 3 days have increased podophyllotoxin production (PTOX) over three times that of the control. Also qPCR analyses showed that the expression of the genes coding for cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase, all involved in the first steps of the PTOX biosynthesis, increased in salicylic acid-treated cells reaching a highest level after 8–12 h of the treatment. However, the expression of pinoresinol–lariciresinol reductase gene in the last steps of the PTOX biosynthesis was not affected by salicylic acid. According to Jumali et al. (2011), treatment with high concentration of salicylic acid is able to increase plant defense mechanism which later will induce the expression of genes encoding the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in Mitragyna speciosa. The previous study of Wen et al. (2005) also showed that salicylic acid could increase the mRNA transcription of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and the biosynthesis of new PAL protein, and increase the activity in grape berry (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon).\n\nIn conclusion, the effect of salicylic acid on regulation of gene expression in the isoprenoid pathway can be applied in biotechnological production of centelloside and our results provide a suitable alternative to improve the centelloside biosynthesis in centella cells.\n\nThis work was supported by National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), Vietnam (Code No. 106.16-2012.80).\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nWe declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nBonfill M  Mangas S  Moyano E  Cusido RM  Palazón J   Production of centellosides and phytosterols in cell suspension cultures of Centella asiatica  Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult 2011 104 61 67 10.1007/s11240-010-9804-7 \nBrinkhaus B  Lindner M  Schuppan D  Hahn EG   Chemical, pharmacological and clinical profile of the East Asian medical plant Centella asiatica .

The potential of carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation by Chlorella pyrenoidosa in enriched bicarbonate medium was evaluated. In the present study, effects of parameters such as pH, sodium bicarbonate concentration and inoculum size were assessed for the removal of CO2 by C. pyrenoidosa under mixotrophic condition. Central composite design tool from response surface methodology was used to validate statistical methods in order to study the influence of these parameters. The obtained results reveal that the maximum removal of CO2 was attained at pH 8 with sodium bicarbonate concentration of 3.33 g/l, and inoculum size of 30 %. The experimental results were statistically significant with R2 value of 0.9527 and 0.960 for CO2 removal and accumulation of chlorophyll content, respectively. Among the various interactions, interactive effects between the parameters pH and inoculum size was statistically significant (P < 0.05) for CO2 removal and chlorophyll accumulation. Based on the studies, the application of C. pyrenoidosa as a potential source for carbon dioxide removal at alkaline pH from bicarbonate source is highlighted.\n\nKeywords\nCarbon concentrating mechanismMixotrophic conditionChlorella pyrenoidosaDissolved inorganic carbonResponse surface methodologyissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nRapid exploitation of fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, etc., has invariably increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to ~400 ppm (Rahaman et al. 2011). Several steps have been taken to control the CO2 emission rates caused during the pre and post-process of various man-made activities. Some of the process includes application of alkanolamine absorbents (Choi et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2013; Pires et al. 2011), desiccant absorption (Stewart and Hessami 2005), adsorption by activated carbon (Lu et al. 2008), mineral carbonate (Wang et al. 2008), zeolite (Wang et al. 2011), molecular sieve, ocean storage (Metz et al. 2005) and geological storage (Holloway 2007). Biofixation of CO2 by microalgae attracted researchers due to its affirmative behavior such as carbon neutral and biomass productivity for its various applications. However, the factors such as economic aspects, life cycle analysis, capital investment and other environment aspects have made these technological impacts slower at commercial level. Unlike other gases, CO2 has some significant limiting factors such as low mass transfer rate, high cost of CO2 capture, its transportation. Meanwhile, when the CO2(g) is passed onto the aqueous solution, it reduces the pH due to the formation of H2CO3 (free CO2) and escapes into the atmosphere thereby resulting in significant CO2 loss during algae culture (Chi et al. 2011). Furthermore, pH is the major determinant of the relative concentrations of the carbonaceous system species in water and could affect the availability of carbon for algal photosynthesis in intensive cultures and at certain situations where the supply of adequate CO2(g) is limited, inorganic carbon sources such as bicarbonate salts (NaHCO3) is best alternative to cultivate microalgae (Hsueh et al. 2009; Lam and Lee 2013; Benemann 1993). Meanwhile, it is also envisaged that mixotrophic mode of cultivating microalgae is best in terms of growth and other applications (Abreu et al. 2012; Bhatnagar et al. 2011; Cheirsilp and Torpee 2012). Based on literature, it can be established that Chlorella sp. is found to be most prominent and efficient in bio-fixing HCO3− and can grew well at mixotrophic conditions (Jeong et al. 2003; Lam et al. 2012).\n\nAccordingly, this study has attempted to add to the current knowledge for carbon sequestration by optimizing process parameters for maximum CO2 removal using microalgae in enriched bicarbonate medium. In this context, we aim to discuss the effect of pH, sodium bicarbonate concentration and inoculum size in mixotrophic mode of cultivation for CO2 removal in microalgae. In addition, we have also monitored chlorophyll as indicator for growth and photosynthetic productivity. Also, in order to optimize the chosen factors and its interactions, central composite design (CCD) using response surface methodology has been employed. The application of response surface methodology is to maximize the effective parameters and minimize the experiments as well as to study the variables individual and interactive effects (Wang et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2009; Khataee and Dehghan 2011).\n\nMaterials and methods\nCulturing of microalgae\nChlorella pyrenoidosa (NCIM 2738) was obtained from the National Centre of Industrial Microorganism (NCIM), Pune, India and was maintained in BG-11 medium (UTEX 2009) under axenic conditions. The stock solution was prepared for all the constituents in media with the following composition for 100 ml: K2HPO4 0.4 g, CaCl2·2H2O 0.36 g, MgSO4·7H2O 0.75 g, NaNO3 15 g, citric acid 0.06 g, Na2EDTA·2H2O 0.01 g, sodium carbonate 0.2 g, ammonium ferric citrate 0.06 g, and A5 trace solution (g/l) components as H3BO3 2.86, MnCl2 1.81, ZnSO4·7H2O 0.222, Na2MoO4·2H2O 0.390, CuSO4·5H2O 0.079, Co(NO3)2·6H2O 0.0494. From the stock solution the media has been prepared for 500 ml with 5 ml from each constituent and 0.5 ml of A5 trace solution. The culture was subjected to continuous illumination (14 WTL5 tungsten filament lamps; Philips Co.,) with 1500 Lux measured using TES light meter (TES CORP) at room temperature 28 ± 1 °C.\n\nDesign of experiments\nThe exponential phase microalgae cells (28 × 105 cells/ml)were taken for experimental studies in synthetic medium (Feng et al. 2011) with the following composition (g/l) glucose 0.4125, NH4Cl0.078, KH2PO4 0.018, MgSO4·7H2O 0.013, CaCl2·2H2O 0.043, FeSO4·7H2O 0.005, A5 Trace solution (1 ml/l), respectively. All the experiments in the study were carried in 500 ml conical flasks containing 300 ml of working solution of synthetic medium with variables (pH, inoculum size and sodium bicarbonate). For analysis, 10 ml of sample was collected using autoclaved syringe (20 ml) for every 3 days once and was subjected for centrifugation at 8000 RPM for 10 min. The pellet was taken for estimation of chlorophyll and supernatant for CO2 analysis. The pH values were chosen to study the microalgae behavior to CO2 in acidic (pH 4 to mimic more availability of free CO2), pH 6 (as standard growth medium range) and alkaline range (pH 8). The sodium bicarbonate concentrations were fixed of 1–3 g per 300 ml each which was scaled up in g/l as depicted in Table 1. The inoculum sizes were fixed (10–30 %) on volume per volume basis as to envisage its effects for CO2 removal and the optical density of 10, 20 and 30 % inoculum sizes used in the study were recorded as 0.594, 0.692 and 0.802, respectively, measured at 660 nm using UV Visible Spectrophotometer (Cyberlab, USA). The pH of the medium was adjusted using 0.1 N NaOH and 0.1 N HCl. All the flasks were manually shaken thrice a day in order to avoid sticking of culture to flasks. The experiments were carried out in duplicates and the average has been taken RSM analysis.Table 1 Experimental range and levels of independent variables\n\nIndependent variables\tDesign variables\tRange and levels\t\n−1\t0\t1\t\npH\t\nA\n\t4\t6\t8\t\nNaHCO3 (g/l)\t\nB\n\t3.33\t6.66\t10\t\nInoculum size (%)\t\nC\n\t10\t20\t30\t\n\n\nResponse surface methodology\nIn order to study the combined effects of the variables (pH, inoculum size and sodium bicarbonate) on the maximum removal of CO2 (%), 20 sets of experiments with appropriate combinations of pH, inoculum size and NaHCO3 concentration were conducted using response surface method (statistical analysis) and the details are presented in Table 2. The CCD under the response surface methodology (RSM) was employed in order to illustrate the nature of the response surface in the experimental design and to elucidate the optimal conditions of the most significant independent variables. A flowchart representation in support of the response surface methodology has been presented in Fig. 1. In this analysis, NaHCO3, inoculum size and pH were chosen as independent variables and the carbon dioxide (CO2) removal rate (%) and its corresponding chlorophyll content were taken as dependent output response variable.Table 2 Central composite design matrix with coded and uncoded variables\n\nRun\t\nA\n\t\nB\n\t\nC\n\tpH\tNaHCO3 (g/l)\tInoculum size (%)\t\n1\t−1\t−1\t−1\t4.0\t3.33\t10\t\n2\t1\t−1\t−1\t8.0\t3.33\t10\t\n3\t−1\t1\t−1\t4.0\t10\t10\t\n4\t1\t1\t−1\t8.0\t10\t10\t\n5\t−1\t−1\t1\t4.0\t3.33\t30\t\n6\t1\t−1\t1\t8.0\t3.33\t30\t\n7\t−1\t1\t1\t4.0\t10\t30\t\n8\t1\t1\t1\t8.0\t10\t30\t\n9\t−1.68179\t0\t0\t2.6\t6.66\t20\t\n10\t1.68179\t0\t0\t9.4\t6.66\t20\t\n11\t0\t−1.68179\t0\t6.0\t1.06\t20\t\n12\t0\t1.68179\t0\t6.0\t12.27\t20\t\n13\t0\t0\t−1.68179\t6.0\t6.66\t3.18\t\n14\t0\t0\t1.68179\t6.0\t6.66\t36.81\t\n15\t0\t0\t0\t6.0\t6.66\t20\t\n16\t0\t0\t0\t6.0\t6.66\t20\t\n17\t0\t0\t0\t6.0\t6.66\t20\t\n18\t0\t0\t0\t6.0\t6.66\t20\t\n19\t0\t0\t0\t6.0\t6.66\t20\t\n20\t0\t0\t0\t6.0\t6.66\t20\t\nFig. 1 Flow chart representation of response surface methodology\n\n\n\nThe three independent variables were varied over two levels with pH between (4 and 8) relative to the centre point (pH 6), the second independent variable (NaHCO3 in g/l) was varied over two levels (3.3 and 9.9 g/l) relative to the centre point (6.6 g/l) and the third independent variable (inoculum size in %) was varied over two levels (10 and 30 %) relative to the centre point (20 %).\n\nThe full factorial CCD matrices of three variables with respect to their uncoded (real) and coded values are presented in Table 2. The response surface method was constructed using MINITAB 16 statistical software. Evaluation of the goodness of fit of the model is done through coefficient determination and analysis of variances. The experimental results were fitted to a second order polynomial Eq. (1): 1 Y=β0+β1A+β2B+β3C+β11A2+β22B2+β33C2+β12AB+β13AC+β23BC where Y is the dependent variable (CO2 removal and chlorophyll content); A, B and C are the independent variable; β0 is the regression coefficient at center point; β1, β2 and β3 are the linear coefficients; β11, β22 and β33 are the quadratic coefficients and β12, β13 and β23 are the second-order interaction coefficients. The developed regression model was evaluated by analyzing the values of regression coefficients, analysis of variance (ANOVA), P and F values. The quality of fit of the polynomial model equation was expressed by the coefficient of determination, R2. The statistical software package was used to identify the experimental design as well as to generate a regression model to predict the optimum combinations considering the effects of linear, quadratic and interactive effects on CO2 removal and corresponding chlorophyll content.\n\nCarbon dioxide removal\nAlkalinity based titrimetric method was used to find out the dissolved inorganic carbon species (H2CO3∗, HCO3−, CO32−) by following standard method (APHA 2005). Briefly, all the samples were centrifuged to obtain supernatant which was titrated against standardized H2SO4 (0.02 N). In a typical experiment, 10 ml of supernatant was taken in a beaker and titrated against H2SO4 using phenolphthalein (pKa 8.6) indicator. After the first end point, titration was continued using methyl orange (pKa 3.8) as the indicator to get the second end point. The readings were noted down and the dissolved inorganic carbon species (H2CO3∗, HCO3−, CO32−) were determined using the formulae in standard method and the sum of the three species are represented as total inorganic carbon species CO2 as mg CaCO3/l which is shown in Eq. (2). Furthermore, the ratio of CO2 to CaCO3 is 1.4 which is taken for CO2 estimation from total inorganic carbon species and the same has been shown in the Eq. (3) (Kemmer 1979). 2 CO2(asCaCO3)mg/l=H2CO3∗+HCO3+CO32-  3 CO2(asCaCO3)mg/l÷1.14=CO2(asCO2)mg/l The CO2 removal (%) was determined by calculating difference between the initial concentration of CO2 (based on Eq. 3) from each experimental runs and final concentration after growth in stationery phase (until no observation of CO2 removal was found) and is expressed below 4 CO2removal(%)=InitialCO2-finalCO2InitialCO2×100 \n\nChlorophyll analysis\nThe chlorophyll content in the medium is determined by spectrometric analysis. Briefly, 5 ml algae culture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was drained off and the sample was re-suspended in ethanol/diethyl ether and kept boiling for 5 min. After boiling, the sample was made up to 5 ml with ethanol/diethyl ether. The optical density was measured at 660 nm and 642.5 nm with solvent as a blank. The chlorophyll content was determined using the formula (Becker 1994): 5 Chlorophyllmg/l=9.9∗OD660-0.77∗OD642.5 \n\nResults and discussion\nCentral composite design: response surface estimation\nThe growth of C. pyrenoidosa under experimental conditions and optimized condition is shown in Fig. 2. It can be noted that, there was a twofold increase in the chlorophyll accumulation in the optimized condition compared to the experimental condition which may be due to the availability of carbon source that helps in synthesizing chlorophyll. The experiments based on design (Table 2) were lasted for 20 days after which the growth was stationery and hence no further improvement was observed on chlorophyll accumulation and CO2 removal and the same has been given as experimental data in RSM. The results of CO2 removal and chlorophyll content (both predicted and experimental) for different design variables (pH, inoculum size and NaHCO3) are presented in Table 3.

R2 and adjusted R2 values represent the proportion of variation in the response that is explained by the model where R describes the amount of variation in the observed responses. The value of R2 is also a measure of fit of the model and the adjusted R2 value compares models with different independent variables. The ANOVA results are presented in Tables 4 and 5 and it can be noted that, the R2 values for CO2 removal and corresponding chlorophyll content are 0.9527 and 0.962 which indicates high degree of correlation between experimental and predicted values.Table 4 ANOVA for fit of CO2 removal (%) from central composite design\n\nSources of variation\tSum of squares\tDegree of freedom\tMean square\t\nF value\t\nP\n\t\nRegression\t3266.42\t9\t358.49\t22.37\t0.0000\t\nResiduals\t159.50\t10\t16.02\t\t\t\nTotal\t3386.65\t\t\t\t\t\n\nR\n(pred.)2 = 95.27 %; R\n(adj.)2 = 91.01 %\n\nTable 5 ANOVA for fit of chlorophyll estimation from central composite design\n\nSources of variation\tSum of squares\tDegrees of freedom\tMean square\t\nF value\t\nP\n\t\nRegression\t27.8792\t9\t3.09769\t28.24\t0.000\t\nResiduals\t1.0999\t10\t0.10999\t\t\t\nTotal\t28.9791\t\t\t\t\t\n\nR\n(pred.)2 = 96.20 %; R\n(adj.)2 = 92.79 %\n\n\n\nThe estimated regression coefficients for removal of CO2 and chlorophyll content are presented in Tables 6 and 7, respectively, along with their corresponding P value and T values.

The interaction effects between the variables (pH and sodium bicarbonate) for carbon dioxide removal is presented in Fig. 3a, as the sodium bicarbonate concentration increases concomitantly with increase in pH, the removal of CO2 increases. This is due to the fact that the microalgae uptake the HCO3 inside the cell and by the action of carbonic anhydrase, it converts HCO3 into CO2 inside the cell. The observations are consistent with the results reported in the literature (Devgoswami et al. 2011).Fig. 3 Surface plot for CO2 removal (%). a Conc. of NaHCO3 (g/l), pH. b Inoculum size (%), pH. c Inoculum size (%), Conc. of NaHCO3 (g/l)\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the interaction effects between the variables (inoculum size and pH) for carbon dioxide removal is presented in Fig. 3b, it can be observed at low pH, even if the inoculum size is high; there is a decrease in the CO2 removal. This could be due to the fact that at low pH all the carbon dioxide will exist in the form of free CO2 (H2CO3) as the algae cannot utilize for metabolic activity (Van Den Hende et al. 2012). Figure 3c depicts the interaction effect between the variables (inoculum size and sodium bicarbonate) for CO2 removal. It can be noted from the figure that, increase in inoculum size with concomitant decrease in sodium bicarbonate concentration, helps to increase the uptake of CO2 (i.e. CO2 removal). This could be due to the regulation of H+ ions into the cell takes place due to which the hydroxide is formed which in turn affects the CO2 removal process (Yeh et al. 2010). In addition, it is also reported that maximum CO2 removal varies with different environment conditions. It is reported that at pH 4 and high bicarbonate concentration (0.3 g/l), maximum removal of CO2 (82.5 %) was achieved (Lam and Lee 2013). Similarly, in another study (Yeh and Chang 2012), it is reported that a maximum removal of CO2 in the range of 90–100 % was achieved with increasing bicarbonate concentration (till 1600 mg/l).\n\nIn the present study, the maximum absorption of CO2 was achieved at pH 8 with initial NaHCO3 concentration of 3.33 g/l and higher inoculum size 30 %. However, with increase in concentration of bicarbonate, there is no significant change in CO2 removal which is due to the fact that additional carbon mechanism results in decreased growth rate causing them in reduction of fixing CO2 rates (Lam and Lee 2013).\n\nResponse surface plots for chlorophyll content\nChlorophyll a is the photosynthetic pigment that is widely present in all eukaryotic microalgae and is synthesized during photosynthetic process as mentioned in Eq. (8). Initially the inorganic carbon is accumulated into microalgal cell by capture of light energy by pigments such as chlorophyll a and b that are presented in chloroplastida of cell (Wang et al. 2012).\n 8 6CO2+6H2O+hνsunlight→C6H12O6 The initial concentrations of chlorophyll are 0.5, 1, 1.34 mg/l for inoculum sizes 10, 20, 30 %, respectively. The surface plots for the interaction effects between the variables (pH and sodium bicarbonate) for the chlorophyll content are presented in Fig. 4a. It can be observed from the figure that, at low sodium bicarbonate concentration, as the pH increases the chlorophyll content increases drastically but at higher sodium bicarbonate concentration only minor variations of chlorophyll content was observed in all pH. This could be due to the excess HCO3− (Ci) ions which are not utilized by microalgae due to insufficient light, as synthesis of chlorophyll will mainly depend upon the light energy during photosynthesis thereby hindrance the process of synthesizing chlorophyll (Amoroso et al. 1998).\nFig. 4 Surface plot for chlorophyll (mg/l). a Conc. of NaHCO3 (g/l), pH. b Inoculum size (%), pH. c Inoculum size (%), Conc. of NaHCO3 (g/l)\n\n\n\nFigure 4b depicts the interaction effects between the variables (inoculum size and pH) for chlorophyll and it can be noticed that at low inoculum size, the chlorophyll content increases with increase in pH. However, the chlorophyll content decreases when the inoculum size increases along with increase in pH. It may be due to the fact that increase in inoculum size causes reduction of H+ ions form the medium (Liu et al. 2014; Chi et al. 2011).\n\nThe interaction effects between the variables (inoculum size and sodium bicarbonate) are presented in Fig. 4c and it can be observed from the figure, that the chlorophyll content decreases when the sodium bicarbonate increases along with the increase in inoculum size. This is due to the fact that the increase in sodium bicarbonate decreases the photosynthetic efficiency. The obtained results are in consistent with the results reported in the literature (White et al. 2013).\n\nAt higher concentration of bicarbonate and pH, there is no significant change in chlorophyll content which could be due to: (1) increasing rates of photorespiration (2) availability of C:N ratio in the medium as the nitrogen is also one of the factor for chlorophyll assimilation.\n\nConclusion\nThe interactive effects between the variables (pH, inoculum size and sodium bicarbonate concentration) for CO2 removal using C. pyrenoidosa in synthetic medium under mixotrophic condition was investigated by employing response surface method with CCD. The maximum removal of CO2 (86 %) was achieved at pH 8 with sodium bicarbonate concentration of 3.33 g/l, and inoculum size of 30 %. The regression value of 0.9527 and 0.962 was observed for CO2 removal and chlorophyll content which implies that the experimental results are statistically significant. The results reveal that C. pyrenoidosa can be used effectively for bio-fixation of CO2 in the form of bicarbonate at alkaline conditions in higher inoculum size under mixotrophic condition. Further investigations on adapting microalgae at alkaline conditions will be a useful for large-scale applications to develop bioenergy feedstock.\n\nThe author’s gratefully acknowledge VIT University for providing necessary funds and facilities to carry out the research work.

Chitosan-dependent exochitosanase enzyme production (6 IU ml−1) in log phase of growth (chitosan utilization rate 0.11 g g−1 cell h−1) was observed for Aspergillus fumigatus in chitosan minimal salt medium and there was no enzyme production in glucose medium. Enzyme production was found to be extracellular and subjected to purification by a number of steps like acetone fractionation as well as column chromatography. 40 % yield and 26-fold of enzyme purification was achieved after all the steps. Purified enzyme was characterized for optimum temperature, pH, ionic strength and substrate specificity. The Km and Vmax for purified exochitosanase enzyme was calculated to be 8 mg ml−1 and 5.2 × 10−6 mol mg−1 min−1. Enzyme was immobilized on polyacrylonitrile nanofibres membrane matrix by adsorption as well as amidination. Enzymatic production of glucosamine was achieved using various chitosan substrates by free/immobilized exochitosanase and compared. Isolated and purified exochitosanase also showed transglycosylation activity.\n\nKeywords\nGlucosamineImmobilizationTransglycosylationChitosanaseDST, GOISR/WOS-A/LS-129/2009Sinha Sujata issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nChitosanase are enzymes which specifically hydrolyze chitosan to produce chitooligomers and monomers, i.e. glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, which depends on types of enzyme. On the basis of their mode of action, two types of chitosanase enzymes have been reported: exo-(EC 3.2.1.165) and endochitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132). Endo-acting enzymes hydrolyse β-1,4 linkages between Gln (glucosamine) residues in partly acetylated chitosan. It is used for production of chitooligosaccharides (COS) by acting on reducing end of chitosan; however, exo-enzymes attacks chitosan from non-reducing end of COS or chitosan to produce Gln (glucosamine) or N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residue (NAG) (Thadathil and Velappan 2014). Endo- and exochitosanase chitosanases have been reported from a number of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and plants (Somashekar and Joseph 1996); however, the study of endochitosanases is more frequent than exo-acting enzymes. Frequent reports of endo-acting chitosanase enzymes can be attributed to the increasing importance of COS in various fields. Importance of study of exochitosanases has been undermined comparatively.\n\nThe end products of exochitosanase hydrolysis are Gln and NAG, which are known for their therapeutic value and used as food supplements. NAG and Gln are used for the treatment of osteoarthritis; however, hydrochloride and sulfate salts of glucosamine are bitter in taste and are avoided. NAG is sweet in taste and is preferred over Gln to be administered orally when used as food supplement, as the therapeutic activity of both the molecule is similar (Kajimoto et al. 1998). NAG and Gln are produced by acid hydrolysis of chitin/chitosan; however, this is not considered to be natural and leads to lot of toxic waste with lower yield (Sakai 1995).\n\nVery few studies on enzymatic production of Gln and NAG have been reported in literature. Exochitosanase enzyme can be used for production of these molecules in an eco-friendly way from various chitosan substrates as they are able to release Gln and NAG from non reducing end of chitosan/chitin molecule.\n\nA new exochitosanase enzyme was isolated from Aspergillus fumigatus IIT-004, which also showed transglycosylation activity. Enzyme was immobilized on PANNFM and was used for hydrolysis of chitosan. Isolated enzyme was also purified, characterized, immobilized and was used for chitodimer production using transglycosylation activity.\n\nMaterials and methods\nMaterials\nCommercial chitosan from crab shell, average molecular weight 290 kDa, 93 % N-deacetylated (DAC); were kind gift from Marine chemicals, Chennai, India. Chitosan from shrimp shell (>75 % deacetylated) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Glucosamine HCl and Chitin were purchased from Hi-media. All other chemicals were procured from SRL, Mumbai, India and were of analytical grade. For isolation and screening, soil was taken from fish market, Chittaranjan Park, New Delhi, India.\n\nIsolation and screening\nChitosan/colloidal chitosan minimal salt (CMS/CCMS) medium (1 % w/v) was used for isolation and screening of chitosanase producing microbes from soil. Soil samples were weighed, suspended in sterile water and plated after serial dilutions (10−1 to 10−6). Composition of the medium was as follows: 0.5 % (w/v) chitosan, 0.5 % yeast extract, 0.2 % K2HPO4, 0.1 % KH2PO4, 0.07 % MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05 % NaCl, 0.05 % KCl, 0.01 % CaCl2 and 2 % Bacto Agar with final pH 6.8.  %. In case of CCMS agar medium 90 ml of colloidal chitosan was added in place of chitosan. The pH was adjusted to 6.0–7.0 before autoclaving. Colloidal chitosan was prepared by dissolving 15 g of 90 % deacetylated chitosan in 1 l (Yabuki et al. 1987).\n\nMicrobial colonies grown on agar plates were point inoculated to CMS broth (100 ml) for screening. Samples were withdrawn at regular interval (24 h) till 1 week and biomass was removed by centrifugation at 4500×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Chitosanase assay was done by dinitrosalicylic (DNS) acid method in supernatant collected after centrifugation of samples. Microbial isolates showing significant chitosanase enzyme activity (≥4 U ml−1) were taken for second stage of screening. Selected microbes after first stage of screening were again inoculated in 100 ml of CMS broth and were grown at room temperature on rotary shaker (180 rpm) for 1 week. 1 ml of samples was withdrawn at 16 h time interval and biomass was removed by centrifugation. Exo-/endochitosanase enzyme activity was checked in supernatant by reducing sugar estimation (DNS method) and thin layer chromatography (TLC).\n\nIn the third stage of screening, inducible/constitutive and specific activity of secreted enzyme was checked. Constitutive production was checked by growing isolates in the 100 ml medium containing glucosamine/glucose (1 % w/v) as carbon source and yeast extract (0.2 % w/v) as nitrogen source along with minimal salts (same as in CMS).\n\nIn the fourth stage of screening, the axenic cultures of the selected microorganisms were inoculated in 200 ml of chitosan minimal salt broth medium in 1 l of Erhlenmeyer flask (Borosil, India) and incubated at 28 °C on orbital shaker at 250 rpm for one week. 5 ml of samples was withdrawn at 8 h interval and cells were harvested by centrifugation (5500×g for 20 min at 4 °C) in pre-weighed falcon tubes or filtration in case of mycelia. The supernatant was checked for extracellular chitosanase enzyme activity. Protein estimation was done by Bradford’s assay and change in medium pH was also monitored with time. Biomass estimation was done by taking dry cell weight for fungal culture and OD 600 nm was recorded for bacterial culture.\n\nPreparation of chitosan and enzyme assay\nChitosanase activity was determined by measuring the reducing sugars produced from chitosan. 300 µL of the crude enzyme was mixed with 500 µL of chitosan (1 % w/v) and 700 µL of acetate buffer (200 Mm, 5.5). Reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Enzyme was deactivated by heating the reaction mixture at 100 °C for 2 min. The reducing sugars in the supernatant were measured by using modification of Schales (1945) method using glucosamine HCl as the calibration standard. One unit of chitosanase was defined as the amount of enzyme that liberated 1 μmol of glucosamine per min under the standard conditions.\n\nEnzyme purification\nEnzyme was purified from culture fluid of Aspergillus after growing for 96 h in a flask containing chitosan minimal salt broth. Production was achieved by inoculation of 1 % (v/v) of spore suspension (4 × 105 spores ml−1) in 2.0 L Erhlenmeyer flasks containing 0.5 l production medium and was incubated on an orbital shaker (200 rpm) at 32 °C. Biomass was harvested by mycelium filtration and all purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Chitosanase activity was checked in the supernatant collected after centrifugation. Acetone fractionation was done by adding four times the volume of chilled Acetone to 0.5 l volume of the culture broth at 4 °C with continuous stirring. Mixture was left for 4 and 12 h and precipitated protein was recovered after centrifugation at 6000×g for 30 min. Pellet was collected and was left for acetone evaporation at room temperature. After complete evaporation of acetone, pellet was suspended in minimum volume of sodium acetate buffer (100 mM, 5.5 pH) till further use at 4 °C. Chitosanase assay was done by DNS and protein estimation was done by Bradford’s method in the suspension and was compared to crude chitosanase enzymes activity in culture broth. Protein was loaded on pre equilibrated DEAE Sepharose column (1 × 20 CM, Merck) with acetate buffer. A flow rate of 2 ml min−1 was maintained and 5 ml fractions were collected. Unbound proteins were washed with buffer and enzyme protein was eluted with 0.1–1 M NaCl in Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.0) gradient. Active fractions were loaded on CM-Sepahrose, bound protein from which were eluted by applying linear 1000 ml gradient of 0.1–1.0 M NaCl in Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.0). Chitosanase enzyme assay was done in each fraction pooled from the columns and was concentrated. Concentrated fractions were loaded onto fast flow Superdex™ (Pharmacia, FPLC) 200 columns (2 × 20 cm) GL and 5 ml of active fraction were collected after maintaining a flow rate of 1.8 ml min−1. Purified chitosanase enzyme was stored at 4 °C.\n\nEnzyme characterization\nThe kinetic parameters were determined by measuring the initial rates of chitosan degradation as a function of chitosan concentration in the range of 10–200 mM (>90 % DAC, 290 kDa) under standard reaction conditions at 37 °C. Reaction rates were measured by monitoring the release of glucosamine upon hydrolysis of chitosan at 540 nm. Vmax and Km were determined by least- squares regression analysis of initial velocity versus chitosan concentration using the double-reciprocal plots of Line weaver- Burk transformation. Discontinuous SDS-PAGE (10 %) was carried out to determine apparent molecular mass. Protein assay was done by Bradford’s method (Bradford 1976). Isoelectric point was determined by method of Su et al. (2006). Acetate buffer was used for pH range 3.5–5.5, phosphate buffer, 6.5–7.5, and Tris–HCl was used for pH, 8.0 and above for determination of pH optimum. Enzymatic reactions were carried out in respective buffers with 1 % w/v chitosan as substrates during enzyme assay; pH stability was checked by incubating enzymes in respective buffers (3.0–9.0) with an interval of 1.0 unit pH for 10 min and doing enzyme assays. Optimum temperature was determined by carrying out enzymatic reaction at various temperatures (20–100 °C) with an interval of 10 °C using 1 % w/v chitosan as substrates in sodium acetate buffer (200 Mm, 5.5). Thermal stability of enzyme was checked by incubating enzyme solution in acetate buffer at these temperatures from 10 to 80 min. Samples were withdrawn at an interval of 10 min and assay was done with 1 % w/v chitosan as substrate at 37 °C. To determine the effect of metal ions like Ba2+, Ca2+, CO2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Hg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+ or Zn2+ was added in form of chloride salt to the enzyme solution (5 ml) at a final concentration of 10 mM. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), monoiodeacetic acid (IAA), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB), Tryptophan modifier 2-hydroxy-5-nitro benzyl bromide (HNB), Tween-20, and Triton X-100 were added to enzyme solution at final concentration of 1 mM to determine the effect of organic substances. The enzyme activity was assayed after incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. Various types of chitosan substrates with degree of deacetylation (DAC) ranging from 50 to 90 %, colloidal chitosan, chitin, colloidal chitin, cellulose, starch were used for enzyme assay to check its substrate specificity.\n\nTransglycosylation\nVarious concentrations (5, 10, 15 and 20 % w/v) of ammonium sulfate, sodium sulphate and sodium chloride were checked for inducing transglycosylation activity. Concentration of Gln and NAG were varied from 0.1 to 5 g/l in the reaction mixture. Final composition of reaction mixture after optimization was as follows: 100 mg of Gln and 500 mg of NAG were mixed in 100 ml of acetate Buffer (200 mM, 5.5) containing 20 % of ammonium sulfate. 2 ml of enzyme (6 U ml−1) was added to this mixture and incubated till 48 h at 50 °C temperature. Reaction mixture became turbid with time and eventually a precipitate was formed, which was collected after centrifugation. Precipitate was washed with 5 ml of aqueous methanol (20 %) solution and was dissolved in 10 ml of water. Insoluble component was removed by centrifugation (5000×g for 10 min). Supernatant was collected and chitooligomers presence was checked by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Supernatant containing COS was lyophilized and stored at 4 °C.\n\nEnzyme immobilization\nEnzyme was immobilized on electrospun polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membranes (PANNFM) matrix and reaction conditions were optimized for maximum protein binding. PANNFM (average diameter 200 nm), a kind gift from National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, India were used for enzyme immobilization by amidination reaction. Nanofibres (0.5 g) surface was treated with absolute ethanol (100 ml) and was bubbled with 1 N HCl (2 ml) for 30 min to produce the corresponding imidoester derivatives, washed with acetate buffer and treated with enzyme (6 U ml−1, 1–10 mg ml−1) solution. Mixture was shaken at room temperature for 6 h and again washed with acetate buffer (200 mM, 5.5 pH) several times to remove unbound enzymes. NFM bound enzymes were lyophilized and were stored for further use. Protein assay was done in supernatant and bound enzyme activity was checked by 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method by measuring the rate of release of reducing sugar. 0.1 g of PANNFM bound enzymes were added to 3 ml of 1 % chitosan solution (90 % DAC, 290 KDa) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a water bath. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 1 N NaOH solution and sample was withdrawn for enzyme and protein assay [6]. The withdrawn reaction mixture was centrifuged at 4500×g for 15 min to remove the chitosan and the concentration of reducing sugar was determined in supernatant. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that could produce 1 µmol reducing sugar (glucosamine) per min.\n\nImmobilization efficiency for chitosanase enzyme was calculated by the following formula: SpecificactivityofimmobilizedenzymesUmg-1/specificactivityofsolublechitosanaseenzymeU/mg×100. \n\nThermal activity and stability of free and immobilized enzymes were measured over a temperature range of 20–90 °C with an interval of 10 °C. PANNFM-chitosanase was incubated in acetate (200 mM, 5.5 pH) buffer at temperatures of 10–90 °C for 30 min and was added to mixture containing acetate buffer (200 mM, 5.5 pH) and chitosan (1 % W/V) was used as substrate (5 ml) for enzyme assay. Release of reducing sugar by incubated PANNFM immobilized enzymes were compared with that of lyophilized enzymes as control. Buffers like glycine–HCl (2.2–3.6); sodium acetate (3.6–5.6); sodium phosphate (5.8–8.5) and glycine-NaOH (8.6–10.6) buffers were used to check stability and activity of PANFNM-chitosanase at different pH. Enzymes were incubated in the above-mentioned buffers suitable in different pH ranges and residual activity was checked for stability studies. Optimum pH for chitosanase enzymes activity was checked by carrying out the enzymatic reactions in these buffers at 37 °C for 30 min. Reusability were evaluated by washing the membrane with acetate buffer (200 mM, 5.5 pH) after completion of each reaction cycle. Chitosan (1 % w/v), 3 ml was used as substrate for starting each new cycle of reaction and this process was repeated up to ten cycles. Storage stability was checked by storing in acetate buffer at 4 °C. Activity was checked after every five days and was monitored up to 60 days. TLC and High-performance TLC (HPTLC) were used for qualitative and quantitative estimation of COS. Hydrolysis of chitosan was done by adding 0.5 g of PANNFM-chitosanase to 50 ml of 1 % (w/v) of chitosan in 200 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C temperatures up to 24 h. Samples were withdrawn at each 1 h time interval and absolute ethanol was added to precipitate COS. Insoluble chitosan was removed by centrifugation (3000×g for 10 min) and supernatant was analyzed for COS production. Samples were concentrated by rotary vacuum evaporation and were subjected to TLC and HPTLC on a silica gel plate (Merck 60, GF-254).\n\nGlucosamine and COS analysis\nGln production using free and immobilized enzyme was carried out in batch condition. Reaction mixture of 1 l was taken in 3.7 l bioreactor at 40 °C and was kept under constant stirring condition. Composition of reaction mixture was in ratio of 4:3:3 (sodium acetate buffer: chitosan (1 % w/v): enzyme: 11 U/mg). 1 g of PANNFM bound enzyme was taken in place of soluble enzyme. Hydrolysis with enzymes was continued till 3 h and aliquots were periodically withdrawn (10 min) from the reaction mixture and heated at 100 °C for 2 min for stopping the enzymatic reaction. Reaction mixture was filtered through whatman filter paper, concentrated by rotary vacuum evaporator at 60 °C and was precipitated with five volumes of ethanol. The precipitate was dried at 60 °C for 2 h and assay was done by DNS method in all the cases of study. Yield of glucosamine production by soluble and immobilized enzyme was calculated by following formula and compared: gofglucosamineproduced/gofchitosan×100 \n\nCOS was precipitated after addition of absolute ethanol (2 ml) in the supernatant. Samples were concentrated by rotary vacuum evaporation and 10 µl volumes were subjected to TLC on a silica gel plate (Merck 60, GF-254). Solvent system composed of 1-propanol:water:concentrated ammonia (7:2:1) was used. The plate was stained using 0.1 % ninhydrin dissolved in ethanol and plates were visualized by drying the plates in an oven at 100 °C for 20 min. COS standards were spotted on TLC plates and were run in the parallel to the sample.\n\nResults\nIsolation and screening\nOut of 80 colonies grown on CMS/CCMS agar medium, 23 were selected for screening on the basis of morphological diversity. Microbial colony morphology was more diverse on CMS agar medium (Hsiao et al. 2008) as compared to CCMS agar medium (Su et al. 2006). Enzyme activity ranged from 1 to 6 U ml−1 and six microorganisms were taken for second stage of screening had equal or more than 4 U ml−1 of crude chitosanase activity. None of the isolates showed endochitosanase activity and four highest exo-enzyme producer (4.0, 6.0, 5.2 and 6.0 U ml−1) were checked for their specific activity.\n\nAll the four strains taken for third stage of screening were found to be secreting chitosanase extracellular and production which was induced by chitosan in all the four microbial strains. Two of them were selected after third stage screening on the basis of highest specific activity (0.7 and 0.4 U mg−1). Submerged fermentation studies in CMS broth were carried out with two isolates for one week and enzyme production, specific activity, pH and growth (dry cell weight) was recorded with time of growth. On the basis of least time, more growth, chitosanase enzyme-specific activity and pH, FM-2 was selected for exochitosanase enzyme production and detail study.\n\nCulture growth kinetics and enzyme production in submerged fermentation\nIdentification and characterization of enzymes producing isolates were done morphologically, physiologically as well as based on genetic homology studies. The fungal strain showing exochitosanse enzyme production was identified as Aspergillus fumigatus (IIT-004) by 18S rDNA gene homology. Sequences for this new isolate producing exochitosanase have been submitted in the Gen Bank (ID: JF708947) (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Photomicrograph of mycelium of Aspergillus\nfumigatus IIT-004 (×100)\n\n\n\nChitosan-dependent\nexochitosanase production (6 U ml−1) in log phase of growth (Fig. 2) was observed by Aspergillus fumigatus in minimal salt medium and there was no enzyme production in dextrose medium. However, in glucosamine minimal salt medium, both growth and exochitosanase production was comparatively lower (4.8 U ml−1).Fig. 2 Exochitosanse enzyme production (triangle) in U ml−1, biomass (rectangle) in g l−1 and extracellular protein (diamond) in mg ml−1 with time for Aspergillus fumigatus IIT-004\n\n\n\nPurification and characterization\nAfter all the purification steps, 26-fold with 40 % yield were achieved for exochitosanase purification (Table 1). Kinetic parameters, optimum pH, temperature etc. were determined for purified enzyme protein (Table 2). Optimum NaCl concentration was found to be 250 mM for exochitosanase and isoelectric point was found to be 6.5.Table 1 Purification steps of exochitosanase enzyme from Aspergillus fumigatus IIT-004\n\nPurification step\tTotal protein (mg)\tTotal activity (U)\tSpecific activity (U mg−1)\tPurification fold\tYield (%)\t\nCrude broth\t10,000\t5620\t0.5\t1\t100\t\nAcetone fractionation\t5050\t4280\t0.8\t2\t70\t\nDEAE Sepharose\t1180\t3380\t3\t6\t60\t\nCM Sepharose\t340\t2750\t8\t16\t48\t\nSuperdex GL-200\t154\t1995\t13\t26\t40\t\nTable 2 Kinetic parameters of purified exochitosanase from Aspergillus sp. when chitosan (>90 % DAC) was used as substrate for enzymatic reaction\n\nKinetic parameters\tEndochitosanase\t\n\nK\nm\n\t8 mg ml−1\n\t\n\nV\nmax\n\t5.2 × 10−6 IU mg−1\n\t\n\nK\ncat\n\t3 × 103 S−1\n\t\nActivation energy\t28 kcal mol−1\n\t\nOptimum pH\t5.5\t\npH stability\t7.5\t\nOptimum temperature\t40 °C\t\nTemperature stability\tUp to 50 °C for 32 h\t\nIsoelectric point\t6.5\t\nMolecular weight\t64 kDa\t\n\n\nEnzyme was inactive against chitin (Table 3) and showed varied activity according to the source of chitosan as only 57 % of enzymatic activity was observed for shrimp shell chitosan (>90 % DAC) as compared to crab shell chitosan (>90 % DAC). Activity decreased with increases in degree of acetylation of chitosan. EDTA, a metal chelator and Zn2+ ions improved the enzyme activity to 120 % and was inhibited by Co2+ ion (Table 4).Table 3 Substrate specificity of the exochitosanase from A fumigatus IIT-004\n\nSubstrate\tExochitosanase\t\nFlaked chitin\t0\t\nColloidal chitin\t0\t\nChitosan flakes (shrimp shell, >90 % DAC)\t57 ± 2.1\t\nColloidal chitosan\t56 ± 3.2\t\nChitosan powder (>90 % DAC) (crab shell)\t100\t\nChitosan (>80 % DAC)\t68 ± 3.4\t\nChitosan (>70 % DAC)\t43 ± 1.2\t\nChitosan (>60 % DAC)\t21 ± 1.2\t\nChitosan (>50 % DAC)\t9 ± 2.1\t\nGlycol chitosan\t12 ± 1.1\t\nCellulose\t0\t\nTable 4 Effect of metal ions, organic inhibitors and surfactant on exochitosanase activity\n\nReagents\tRelative activity (%)\t\n\tExochitosanase\t\nControl\t100\t\nCaCl2\n\t88 ± 2.1\t\nMnCl2\n\t98 ± 3.2\t\nHgCl2\n\t76 ± 4.1\t\nCuCl2\n\t98 ± 2.1\t\nCdCl2\n\t90 ± 0.5\t\nMgCl2\n\t95 ± 0.4\t\nNiCl2\n\t99 ± 0.6\t\nFeCl2\n\t87 ± 1.2\t\nZnCl2\n\t102 ± 2.1\t\nBaCl2\n\t98 ± 3.1\t\nNiCl2\n\t87 ± 1.2\t\nCoCl2\n\t32 ± 2.1\t\nEDTA\t120 ± 4.3\t\nNBS\t100 ± 3.2\t\nDEPC\t100 ± 0.2\t\nDTT\t90 ± 0.4\t\nβ-Mercaptoethanol\t100 ± 0.4\t\nIAA\t93 ± 4.3\t\nNEM\t66 ± 2.1\t\npCMB\t88 ± 2.1\t\nHNB\t65 ± 2.1\t\nTween 20\t76 ± 2.1\t\nTriton X-100\t88 ± 2.9\t\n\n\nTransglycosylation reaction\n15 % of ammonium sulfate was found to be optimum for catalyzing transglycosylation reaction. Optimum time and temperature was found to be 36 h and 50 °C respectively. Chitodimer was formed as a result of this reaction (Fig. 3). Other salts used for this study were sodium sulfate and sodium chloride (5–20 %), no such activity was observed with these two salts. Transglycosylation reaction was not observed when only glucosamine or N-acetyl-d-glucosamine was used in the reaction mixture.Fig. 3 Thin layer chromatography of transglycosylation reaction products of exochitosanase enzyme from A fumigatus IIT-004: a standard of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; b standard of glucosamine; c blank; d, e three bands of COS for N-acetyl-d- glucosamine (NAG), glucosamine (Gln) and chitodimer\n\n\n\nImmobilization of chitosanase enzyme\nEnzyme was immobilized on PANNFM by adsorption and amidination reaction. Maximum binding was achieved by amidination reaction after 30 min of surface treatment time and 80 % of immobilization efficiency was achieved at 2 h. Protein loading by adsorption and amidination reactions was comparable, but reusability was nil in adsorption process. The value of Km for immobilized enzyme was recorded to be 24 mg/ml by Line weaver–Burk Plot. Optimum temperature was found to be 50 °C, optimum pH shifted to 5.8 from 5.5,which could be explained by charge on support material i.e. PANNFM and retained more than 50 % of its catalytic activity even after 10 batches of uses in aqueous solution. Previously reported decrease in enzyme activity after 5 to 6 uses (Kuroiwa et al. 2008) was done on nanoparticles. Storage stability of immobilized also improved as compared to soluble enzyme. More than 60 % of residual activity was observed even after storing more than 30 days at room temperature and minor loss in activity (10–20 %) further even after 30 days of storage.\n\nGlucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine production\nGln production was achieved by enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan with free and immobilized enzyme. Maximum gln of 4 mg ml−1 could be produced with soluble exochitosanase after 3 h of reaction time. Sodium acetate buffer (200 mM, 5.5) was used in the reaction mixture and chitosan (>90 % DAC, 290 KDa) of 3.5 % (w/v) was found to be maximum substrate concentration. N-acetyl-d-glucosamine was also produced by chitosan hydrolysis and concentration of 0.04 mg ml−1 was achieved after completing the reaction. Chitosan of (>90 % DAC) was found to be best substrate for glucosamine production.\n\nGln production was achieved by immobilized enzyme at 50 °C, and concentration increased up to 70 min. Maximum concentration of 4.6 g was achieved using immobilized exochitosanase enzyme per 10 g of chitosan carrying 1.8 U mg−1 specific activities after 2 h of reaction and yield was 80 % as compared to soluble exochitosanase (Fig. 4). Yield of Gln increased with chitosan having lower degree of acetylation and could be produced from a variety of chitosan substrates.Fig. 4 Time course on the production of glucosamine per gram of chitosan by soluble (square) and PANNFM-immobilized (triangle) exochitosanase: chitosan (>90 % DAC) 1 % (w/v), enzyme: 0.5 g of PANNFM (2.5 mg enzyme g−1), sodium acetate buffer (200 mM, 5.5 pH) soluble exochitosanase enzyme (4 U mg−1)\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nNumerous reports of isolation of endochitosanase secreting microbes from ecological niches are available (Somashekar and Joseph 1996; Thadathil and Velappan 2014); however comparatively, studies on isolation of exochitosanase secreting microbes are scantily available. More number of microbial colonies on colloidal chitosan medium can be explained by the fact that more acetyl groups are removed while preparing the colloidal form of chitosan which improved solubility. Soil collection from fish waste dumping zone also improved the chances of getting diverse group of microbial population as compared to other samples. It was concluded that soil could be good source of novel microbial species secreting industrial enzymes. Enrichment culture technique could be better than direct isolation.\n\nAbsence of enzyme production in non chitosan medium indicated that isolate was not producing enzyme constitutively but the enzyme production was induced one.\n\nOptimum temperature of 60 °C have been reported for Bacillus sp. strain S65 (Su et al. 2006), Acinetobacter CHB101 (Shimosaka et al. 1995), Bacillus cereus D-11 (Gao et al. 2008) and Bacillus cereus TKU018 (Wang et al. 2009). Chitosanase enzyme from Paenibacillus sp. 1794 has been reported to be stable up to 80 °C for 10 min (Zitouni et al. 2013). Nocardia and Aspergillus sp. have been reported to be stable up to 50 °C (Nanjo et al. 1990; Zhang et al. 2000). Optimum pH of 5.5 has also been recorded for intracellular chitosanase enzyme from Mucor circinelloides (Struszczyk et al. 2009), Nocardia (Nanjo et al. 1990) and Aspergillus sp. (Zhang et al. 2000).\n\nTransglycosylation reaction by enzymes for synthesis of higher oligosaccharides has been studied previously using salts at higher concentration (Usui et al. 1990) and using a microreactor especially designed for lowering the water content (Hsiao et al. 2008). These types of reactions can be enhanced by increasing the substrate concentration, lowering the water content and products are precipitated by reversing the hydrolysis reaction. Similar results have been reported for lysozyme in presence of ammonium sulfate (Akiyama et al. 1995). Change in reaction conditions can lead to unusual catalytic activity, i.e. where hydrolytic enzymes can be used for synthesis of COS by transglycosylation activity.\n\nLipase immobilization on PANNFM by amidination reaction has been reported previously (Li et al. 2007) which required only 5 min of surface activation. The difference may be attributed to difference in processing and fabrication of nanofibres. Increases in Km value indicated low affinity towards substrates which may be attributed to distortion of active sites of enzyme due to covalent attachment or due to reduced access of substrates depending upon mass transfer limitation. Increase in temperature optimum was attributed to restriction of conformational mobility due to covalent bond between matrix and enzyme and as a result higher activation energy, same trend has been observed for immobilized lipase (Li et al. 2007), which could be explained by charge on support material i.e. PANNFM and retention of more than 50 % of its catalytic activity even after 10 batches of uses can be compared to previously reported decrease in enzyme activity after 5 to 6 uses (Kuroiwa et al. 2008) which was done on nanoparticles.\n\nExochitosanases reportedly cut chitosan and COS from non reducing ends and produce glucosamine (Somashekar and Joseph 1996). Fermentative production of gln has been reported previously (Sitangagng et al. 2010; Jung et al. 2006). Improper mixing of reaction mixture and mass transfer limitation could be explained as reason behind lower yield of product as compared to free enzymes. Immobilized chitosanase have been reported previously for COS production (Kuroiwa et al. 2008; Song et al. 2014; Sinha et al. 2012) but very few reports regarding production of glucosamine are available (Sinha et al. 2011).\n\nGlucosamine can be produced enzymatically for human consumption and with optimization yield can be enhanced at industrial scale for large scale production. Cost effective production can be achieved using chitosan as substrates due to its wider availability as marine waste. Immobilized enzymes are more effective for production of glucosamine due to their high thermo stability and storage stability.\n\n\nSujata Sinha is thankful to Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India for providing the grant in the form of WOS-A scheme.

TGA revealed a significant improvement in the grafted gel’s thermal stability from 200 to 300 °C. Optimization of the enzyme loading capacity increased gradually by 28-fold from 32 U/g gel to 899 U/g gel beads, retaining 99 % of the enzyme immobilization efficiency and 88 % of the immobilization yield. The immobilization process highly improved the enzyme’s thermal stability from 50 to 70 °C, which is favored in food industries, and reusability test retained 100 % of the immobilized enzyme activity after 20 cycles. These results are very useful on the marketing and industrial levels.\n\nKeywords\nNaringinaseAspergillus nigerImmobilizationART-FTIR (total reflectance Fourier transform infrared)TGA (thermal gravimetric analysis) and biopolymer (grafted alginate gel beads)http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007787National Research Centre1Abd El Aty Abeer A. issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nMicroorganisms are used in various fields especially in industries due to their ability to produce various enzymes, among these enzymes is naringinase one of the great important enzymes (Deene and Lingappa 2013).\n\nNaringinase (EC3.2.1.40) is a hydrolytic enzyme containing both α-l-rhamnosidase and β-glucosidase activities. Firstly, α-l-rhamnosidase hydrolyzes naringin into rhamnose and prunin (4,5,7-trihydroxy flavanone-7-glucoside), the prunin is then simultaneously converted into glucose and naringenin (4,5,7-trihydroxy flavanone) by the β-glucosidase activity (Yusof et al. 1990).\n\nNaringinase is used in debittering of citrus juices, and naringinase also finds applications in the production of glycopeptide antibiotic, deglycosylation of flavonoids, and gellan depolymerisation (Kamiya et al. 1985; Puri et al. 2005). The hydrolysis products (rhamnose, prunin, and naringenin) showed biological activities and can be used as starting materials for the synthesis of substances applied in pharmaceutics, cosmetics, and food technology (Ellenrieder et al. 1998).\n\nNaringin (4,5,7-trihydroxy flavanone-7-rhamnoglucoside) is a bitter flavonoid present in several citrus fruits, especially grapefruits (Puri and Banerjee 2000). Naringin is the source of undesirable bitterness especially in citrus fruit juice industry; therefore, it must be removed or reduced its levels from the processed products (Yusof et al. 1990; Hasegawa and Maier 1993). This bitter taste was decreased by the reduction of naringin content which was carried out using chemical methods, but this method had several drawbacks resulting in the inferior quality of fruit juice (Puri et al. 2005). Nowadays, microbial naringinase has completely replaced the chemical methods due to cost-effective production and economically viable process (Puri and Banerjee 2000).\n\nMany carriers for enzyme immobilization are found in the literature; however, efficient commercial carriers suitable for immobilization of enzymes used in industries are few and relatively expensive (Bickerstaff 1995). Most carriers are based on synthetic or natural polymers. The immobilization technique would enable the reusability of enzymes for tens of times, easier product separation, reducing the enzyme and the enzymatic product’s cost significantly. To prepare a new carrier for enzyme immobilization, it is naturally an advantage if substances that are already permitted for use in the pharmaceutical or food industries can be utilized. Hydrogels such as alginates, carrageenan, and chitosan are polysaccharide families belonging to this category that are commercially available, have diverse features, and are available at a reasonable cost (Hugerth et al. 1997). One of the main disadvantages of these biopolymers is that they are usually used for immobilization of enzymes using non-covalent bonds due to the lack of functionalities, for example, immobilized glucoamylase using Ca-alginate gel coated with partially quaternized polyethyleneimine (Tanaka et al. 1984). Unfortunately, the entrapment of enzymes in hydrogels is often characterized by some diffusion of the biocatalyst from the support, particularly for enzymes with molecular weight less than 300 kDa (Tanriseven and Dogan 2002). Elnashar and Hassan (2014), Elnashar et al. (2013), and Awad et al. (2013) have completely studied the covalently bond immobilizing enzymes by using hydrogels.\n\nIn this work, naringinase produced by marine-derived fungus Aspergillus niger was immobilized onto grafted alginate gel beads which consider as thermally stable biopolymer to improve the enzyme stability to be convenient for different industrial applications and evaluation of the effects of immobilization on naringin hydrolysis.\n\nMaterials and methods\nChemicals\nSodium alginate (Alg) was obtained from Fluka. Polyethyleneimine (PEI), glutaraldehyde (GA), and naringin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company. Other chemicals were of analar or equivalent quality.\n\nMicroorganism and its maintenance\nThe marine-derived fungus A. niger, isolated from decayed wood samples of old ships, submerged in sea water of Ismailia, Egypt (Shehata and Abd El Aty 2014). Fungal isolate was routinely grown on malt extract agar medium at 27 °C and preserved at −80 °C in 50 % (v/v) glycerol (Höller et al. 1999).\n\nCultivation conditions and crude enzyme extraction\nThe optimal combinations of the major constituents of media for maximal naringinase production were evaluated as follows: 15 g orange rind waste, 30 ml moisture content, 1 % grape fruit powder, 1 % NaNO3, 0.5 % KH2PO4, 5 mM MgSO4, 5 mM FeSO4, and pH 7.5. Flasks were autoclaved for 20 min at 121 °C and cooled to room temperature before inoculation (Shehata and Abd El Aty 2014). Sterilized solid-state fermentation was inoculated with 1.0 ml inoculum containing (5 × 106 spores/ml) of 5-day-old culture. The contents of the inoculated flasks were well mixed and incubated at 28 °C for 10 days. At the end of incubation period, 50 ml of sodium acetate buffer 0.1 M, pH 4.0, was added to the cultures and placed on a rotary shaker for 30 min. The suspension was filtered through a nylon cloth, followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min, 4 °C. The filtrate obtained was used for determination of naringinase activity (Abd El Aty et al. 2014; Faten and Abeer 2013)\n\nEnzymatic assay of naringinase activity\nNaringinase was assayed for its activity by measuring the rate of glucose formation from the two-step hydrolysis of naringin to prunin and rhamnose by α-l-rhamnosidase and to naringenin and glucose using by β-glucosidase. The reaction mixture consists of 0.8 ml of 0.2 % naringin solution in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0; 0.2 ml enzyme was incubated at 50 °C for 60 min. One ml of the reaction mixture was tested for the presence of glucose by dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (Miller 1959). One unit of naringinase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that liberates 1 µmole of reducing sugars, expressed as glucose, under the given assay conditions.\n\nPreparation and grafting of alginate beads (Alg/(Ca2+ + PEI)/GA)\nGrafted gel beads were prepared according to Elnashar (2010) after slight modifications. Sodium alginate (Alg) was dissolved in distilled water to give a final concentration of 1.5 % (w/v). The alginate solution was dropped through a nozzle of 300 μm using the Innotech Encapsulator in a hardening solution containing 2.5 % (w/v) CaCl2 (Ca2+) and 1 % PEI solution and was soaked for 3 h. After washing, the beads were soaked in GA solution of 2.5 % (v/v) for 3 h.\n\nElucidation of the modified gels using ATR-FTIR\nThe attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared has been used to identify the new functionalities on the grafted alginate gels. IR transmission spectra were obtained using a FTIR spectrophotometer (FTIR-8300, Shimadzu, Japan). The test is aiming to prove the presence of the new functional group, carbonyl group, formed at all the different formulas. A total of 2 % (w/w) of the sample was mixed with dry potassium bromide (KBr). The mixture was ground into a fine powder using an agate mortar before it was compressed into a KBr disk under a hydraulic press at 10,000 psi. Each KBr disk was scanned 16 times at 4 mm/s at a resolution of 2/cm over a wave number range of 400–4000/cm, using Happ-Genzel apodization. The characteristic peaks were recorded.\n\nThermal gravimetric analysis (TGA)\nThermal gravimetric analysis was performed to prove the formation of a strong polyelectrolyte complex between the Alg and PEI followed by GA. The thermal behavior of the different gel formulations (Alg), (Alg + PEI), (Alg + PEI + GA), and (Alg + PEI + GA + Enzyme) was characterized by the TGA (SDT 600, TA Instruments, USA). Approximately 3–6 mg of the dried gels was weighed into an alumina pan. The samples were heated from 50 to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.\n\nImmobilization of naringinase onto grafted gel beads\nOne gram of gel beads was incubated with 2 ml of naringinase solution in appropriate concentration for 24 h at 4 °C. At the end of incubation period gel, beads were washed twice with 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, and used for naringinase assay.\n\nAssay for immobilized naringinase was carried out by adding one gram of the immobilized gel beads to 2 ml of 0.2 % naringin solution in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, and the liberated glucose was estimated as cited before.\n\nOptimization of the enzyme loading capacity and loading time using grafted alginate beads\nIn this experiment, 1 g of gel beads was incubated in 2 mL of enzyme solution in different dilutions ranged from 10 to 100 %, enzyme dilutions were prepared in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 4. Enzyme solution and gel beads were incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The enzyme loading capacity (E.L.C.) or the amount of enzyme units immobilized onto gel beads was calculated as follows: 1 E.L.C.=(Mo-Mf)/W, where Mo is the initial enzyme activity (U), Mf is the enzyme activity of the filtrate (U) after immobilization, and W is the weight of wet gel beads (g). The best formulation was used for the naringinase catalytic experiments. On the other hand, the immobilization efficiency (I.E.) has been also calculated using the following equation: 2 I.E.%=Mi/Mo∗100, where Mo is the initial enzyme activity (U), and Mi is the enzyme activity of the immobilized enzyme per gram gel beads (U).\n\nMoreover, the immobilization yield (I.Y.) has been calculated from the following equation: 3 I.Y.%=C/A-B∗100, where A is the activity of free enzyme added, and B is the activity of remaining enzyme, whereas C is the activity of immobilized enzyme. For determination of the optimum loading time, known concentration of enzyme was incubated with gel beads for different periods of time ranged from 2 to 24 h. The data were normalized to 100 % relative activity. The relative activity at each time is expressed as a percentage of the 100 % activity.\n\nEvaluation of naringinase catalytic activity\nVarious factors were studied to evaluate the catalytic activity of both the free and immobilized naringinase such as reaction temperature, effect of pH, and thermal stability of the enzymes, as follows:\n\nOperation temperature\nThe optimum temperature for the free and immobilized naringinase was examined by incubating the reaction mixture for both free and immobilized enzymes at different temperatures ranging from 30 to 80 °C for 1 h. The optimum temperature has been taken as 100 % activity and the relative activity at each temperature is expressed as a percentage of the 100 % activity.\n\npH profile\nThe optimum pH for the free and immobilized naringinase was examined by incubation of free enzyme and loaded beads at optimum temperatures for 1 h into 1 mL of 1 mM of naringin dissolved at pHs 3–7.5 using different buffers. The data were normalized to 100 % activity. The highest enzyme activity is expressed as 100 %, and each pH is expressed relatively as a percentage of the 100 % activity.\n\nEnzyme thermal stability\nTo prove the stability of the immobilized enzyme at high temperatures, the enzymes were incubated in the enzyme’s buffer solution for a period of 3 h at 50, 60, and 70 °C, and then they were examined for enzyme activity as above. The data were normalized to 100 % activity. The highest enzyme activity is expressed as 100 %, and each temperature is expressed relatively as a percentage of the 100 % activity.\n\nNaringin hydrolysis, determination of Km and Vmax, shelf and operational stability of immobilized naringinase\nTo evaluate the efficiency of the immobilized enzyme, three main experiments were carried out. The naringin hydrolysis using the optimum conditions for the free and immobilized enzyme, the shelf stability and reusability of the immobilized enzyme.\n\nNaringin hydrolysis\nEqual units, 900 U, of free and immobilized enzymes were incubated at 70 °C for 1 h at pH 4 into the assay mixture. Samples were withdrawn at interval times from 15 to 120 min and analyzed for naringin hydrolysis.\n\nKm and Vmax of free and immobilized naringinase\nThe Lineweaver–Burk plot (double reciprocal) method was used to obtain the Michaelis–Menten kinetic models adequate for the description of the hydrolysis of naringin by the free and the immobilized enzyme. Apparent Km and Vmax of free and immobilized naringinase were determined by plotting 1/[S] against 1/[V], respectively.\n\n 4 S/Vo=1/Vmax∗S+Km/Vmax, where [S] is the substrate concentration (naringin), Vo is the initial enzyme velocity, Vmax is the maximum enzyme velocity, and Km is the Michaelis constant and is defined only in experimental terms and equals the value of [S] at which Vo equals 1/2Vmax. The assay mixture comprised 900 U of free and immobilized enzyme, a substrate concentration of 29–230 mM at 70 °C, and pH 4 for 1 h.\n\nFree and immobilized enzymes’ shelf stability\nThe shelf stability was studied for the free and the immobilized enzyme over a period of 10 weeks at 4 °C. Ten grams of the immobilized enzyme containing 900 U and their equivalent of the free enzyme (900 U/mL) were stored in 0.1 M of acetate buffer (pH 4) at 4 °C. The samples were covered to avoid dehydration and loss of the buffer. A sample of the free enzyme (1 mL) or the immobilized enzyme (1 g gel beads) has been withdrawn every week and assayed for enzyme activity. The starting operational activity was considered as 100 % relative activity, and data were normalized to 100 % activity.\n\nOperational stability\nThe reusability of immobilized naringinase was studied using the novel grafted gel beads. The best conditions obtained from the optimum pH, temperature, and hydrolysis of naringin were used. One gram of the grafted gel beads was added to 2 ml of 0.2 % naringin solution in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 70 °C in a shaking water bath, and the substrate solution was assayed as above. The same gel disks were then washed with sodium acetate buffer and re-incubated with another substrate solution; this procedure was repeated for 20 times, and the initial activity was considered as 100 %. The relative activity was expressed as a percentage of the starting operational activity.\n\nResults and discussion\nGrafted alginate elucidation structure\nThe FTIR spectroscopic analysis of Alg gel beads, grafted beads, and immobilized one were carried out from 400 to 4000 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 1. The FTIR bands of the Alg/Ca2+ (spectrum A) showed characteristic functional groups (–COO− stretching) were present, with a broad asymmetrical band at 1610 cm−1 and a narrower symmetrical band at 1420 cm−1. The spectra for aminated beads showed a new broad peak at 3429 cm−1 which is corresponding to NH2 group that indicated the presence of amine group on the surface of beads (spectrum B), while glutaraldehyde activated beads showed new two peaks. The first of them is at 1717 cm−1 which refers to the (C=O) group of a free aldehyde end of glutaraldehyde, and the another peak is at 1660 cm−1 which is corresponding to Schiff’s base (C=N–) group which is the result of reaction of NH2 end groups with glutaraldehyde (spectrum C). Finally, the immobilized beads gave broader peak at 3457 cm−1, (spectrum D) indicating an increase in the concentration of NH2 groups which was found naturally in the enzyme. From all above, we can confirm that the process of amination, activation, and immobilization took place successfully. This result is in agreement with other published results (Tanaka et al. 1984).Fig. 1 FTIR of A calcium alginate (Alg), B alginate hardened with calcium and polyethylenimine (Alg/PE + Ca2+), C alginate and polyethylenimine/Ca2+ beads followed by glutaraldehyde (Alg/PE + Ca+2/GA). D The interaction between the grafted alginate beads and naringinase\n\n\n\nThe TGA thermo-gram of gel beads is shown in Fig. 2, and data are tabulated in Table 1. The treatment of Alg with PEI followed by GA showed a gradual and obvious improvement in their TGA. The TGA of Alg was at 200 °C compared to Alg/PEI which was at 230 °C and that of Alg/PEI/GA increased to 250 °C, and finally, after immobilization it shifted to 300 °C.Fig. 2 TGA thermographs of alginate gel beads (A), aminated beads (B), activated beads (C), and immobilized one (D)\n\nTable 1 TGA results of the gel beads formation steps and immobilization of naringinase\n\nType\tTGA, °C\t\nAlginate\t200\t\nAlginate + polyethyleneimine\t230\t\nAlg + PEI + glutaraldehyde\t250\t\nAlg + polyethyleneimine + glutaraldehyde + enzyme\t300\t\n\n\nThe gels’ thermal improvement could be explained by the formation of polyelectrolyte interaction between the polyanions (–COO−) of alginate and the polycations (–NH3+) of the PE. Further hardening of the gel beads using GA could be attributed to the formation of a stronger cross linking of the gel beads due to formation of Schiff’s base between the free PEI’s amino groups and GA (Elnashar et al. 2009).\n\nImmobilization and optimization of the enzyme loading capacity (E.L.C.)\nData of the E.L.C. as well as the immobilization efficiency are tabulated in Table 2. Data showed that the E.L.C. increased gradually by 26-fold from 32 U/g gel to reach 853 U/g gel by increasing the enzyme concentration to zero dilution. This increase is due to gradual enzyme loading reaching its saturation at no enzyme dilution (Elnashar et al. 2009). According to Table 3, we achieved an enzyme loading of 899 U/g gel beads after only 12 h of incubation. The enzyme immobilization efficiency percent increased gradually by increasing the loading time reaching its maximum of 99 % with immobilization yield of 88 % of the total enzyme units after 12 h of contact time. Further soaking of the beads in contact with the enzymes has no positive effect and in some cases it reduced the enzyme activity. These results can be explained by assuming that the increase in contact time between the enzyme and the support created more bonds per enzyme molecule. Due to possible structure deformation during immobilization, the enzyme molecules can orientate themselves to remain with the active site blocked, thereby restraining the accessibility of the enzyme active site toward the substrate. Also, the longer incubation time could increase the probability for covalent modification close to the active site increasing enzyme inactivation (Costa et al. 2001).Table 2 Optimization of the enzyme loading capacity using grafted alginate beads\n\nEnzyme concentration percent (%)\tTotal enzyme units (soaking solution)\tImmobilized enzyme\nU/g beads\t(E.L.C.)\tImmobilization yield % (I.Y. %)\t\n100\t900\t868\t835\t96\t\n75\t675\t610\t558\t90\t\n50\t450\t398\t318\t88\t\n25\t250\t210\t180\t84\t\n10\t80\t60\t32\t75\t\nTable 3 Optimization of the enzyme loading time using grafted alginate beads\n\nDifferent loading times (h)\tTotal enzyme units (soaking solution)\tImmobilized enzyme\nU/g beads\tImmobilization efficiency % (I.E.%)\tImmobilization yield % (I.Y.%)\t\n2\t900\t100\t11\t61\t\n4\t900\t233\t25\t29\t\n6\t900\t400\t44\t11\t\n8\t900\t600\t66\t22\t\n10\t900\t876\t97\t86\t\n12\t900\t899\t99\t88\t\n14\t900\t830\t92\t81\t\n16\t900\t876\t97\t86\t\n18\t900\t890\t98\t87\t\n20\t900\t888\t98\t87\t\n22\t900\t876\t97\t86\t\n24\t900\t889\t98\t87\t\n\n\nEffect of temperature and pH on naringinase activity\nOne of the main goals of this article was to improve the enzyme’s thermal stability to be suitable for industrial use as previously mentioned in the introduction. As shown in Fig. 3a, temperature of the free enzyme was at 50 °C and that of the immobilized enzyme was at 70 °C. This fact was supported by Chao et al. (1986) and Brennan (2002), by providing that only polyamines substantially improved hydrogel’s thermal stability. This shift of the enzyme’s optimum temperature after immobilization could be regarded to the formation of a molecular cage around the protein (enzyme), which protected the enzyme’s molecules from the bulk temperature. The optimum temperature of around 70 °C for hydrolysis of naringin by naringinase increased the potential for immobilized naringinase to be used on an industrial scale (Vila-Real et al. 2010). The optimum pH values for the free and the immobilized naringinase were very close as they were at pH 4.5 and pH 4, respectively. The immobilized naringinase displayed a higher retention of activity at pH 4 when compared with the free enzyme Fig. 3b. The shift to lower pH values is commonly found in immobilization of naringinase (Ellenrieder et al. 1998; Chang et al. 2011). However, the immobilized enzyme showed higher retention of activity compared to the free enzyme in most pH values. For example, at pH 7.5, the immobilized enzyme retained 60 % of its activity, whereas the free one completely lost its activity.Fig. 3 \na Temperature profile of the free and immobilized naringinase enzyme. b pH profile of the free and immobilized naringinase enzyme\n\n\n\nDue to the fact that most of the fruit juices that can be treated with naringinase normally show acidic pH values, this shift toward lower pH is an important improvement when considering the possible application of this immobilized system to the treatment of fruit juices.\n\nThermal stability of the free and immobilized naringinase\nThe thermal stability of the free and immobilized enzymes is shown in Fig. 4. The temperature stability of the free and immobilized enzymes at 50–70 °C revealed that the immobilized form is more stable for a longer time than the free enzyme. For example, at 50 °C, and for an incubation period of 120 min, the immobilized enzymes retained 66 % of its relative activity, whereas that of the free enzymes completely lost its activity. At 60 °C, the temperature at which the enzymes are preferably used in industries to avoid microbial contamination, the immobilized enzymes retained 52 % of their relative activity at 90 min, whereas the free one completely lost its activity. At 70 °C, the immobilized enzyme still retained 46 % of its relative activity after 90 min. In general, the decrease of enzymes’ activity might be due to the disturbance of globular structure of the protein by heat.Fig. 4 Temperature-stability profile of free and immobilized naringinase at 50, 60, and 70 °C\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the immobilization process stabilized more of the 3D structure of the enzyme; in addition, the polymeric material for immobilization forms a cage surrounding the enzyme to protect it from the outside heat. In brief, the immobilized preparations were more stable than the soluble enzymes at higher temperatures and that is favorable in industries (Elnashar and Hassan 2014). Furthermore, the significant thermal stability of the immobilized naringinase could be resulted from the inside porous structure and microenvironment of the supports which prevented some intermolecular or protein–surface interactions (Le-Tien et al. 2004; Lei et al. 2011).\n\nNaringin hydrolysis using the free and immobilized naringinase\nThe results of the hydrolysis of naringin using the free and immobilized naringinase are shown in Fig. 5. At zero time, we had 100 % naringin. At 45 min, the free enzyme hydrolyzed 50 % of naringin compared to 40 % for the immobilized enzyme. However, 100 % hydrolysis of naringin was obtained for both the free and immobilized enzymes at 60 and 90 min, respectively. This close result between the free and immobilized enzymes could be regarded too little to no diffusion limitation has encountered the product substrate conversion using the immobilized enzyme (Elnashar et al. 2013). These results were in accordance to Yalim et al. (2004) who found that less than 5 % naringin was left after 86–97 min.Fig. 5 Hydrolysis of naringin using the free and immobilized naringinase\n\n\n\nMichaelis constant of free and immobilized naringinase\nThe Michaelis constant of the free and immobilized naringinase was calculated using the double reciprocal plot method (Lineweaver–Burk plot) as shown in Fig. 6. The calculated Km for the free enzyme was 5.9 mM, and similar result was obtained by Ellenrieder et al. (1998) and Soria et al. (2004). After immobilization, the apparent Km increased to 41 mM indicating that a higher concentration of substrate is needed for the immobilized enzyme as the immobilized enzymes are not accessible as the soluble enzymes to the substrates. The maximum reaction velocity “Vmax” values for the immobilized enzyme were astounding: it increased from 8.3 mmol min−1 L−1 for free enzyme to 38.2 mmol min−1 L−1 for the immobilized one. This suggests that the native conformation of the enzyme is not altered at all after immobilization (Gopinath and Sugunan 2006). The increase of the enzyme’s Vmax after immobilization could be interpreted from an energetic point of view as follows: for catalysis to be efficient, the loss of entropy, arising out of the initial binding of substrate to enzyme to form the enzyme–substrate complex, must be paid for by the binding energy released from them favoring interaction between enzyme and substrate (Chang et al. 2011). This implies that the loss of entropy, on forming the enzyme–substrate complex acts to increase its dissociation constant. Thus, weak binding of substrate to enzyme presents the enormous catalytic advantage of the intermolecular effect. In general, the behavior of increased Vmax after immobilizing enzymes has been reported by many authors (Tanriseven and Dogan 2002; Roy et al. 2003).Fig. 6 Michaelis constant of free and immobilized naringinase using Lineweaver–Burk plot method\n\n\n\nOperational and shelf stability of immobilized naringinase\nThe shelf stability of the free and immobilized enzymes was studied at 4 °C for 10 weeks as shown in Fig. 7. The free enzyme lost about 20 % of its activity after 2 weeks, and after that, it declined to 43 % after 5 weeks and dramatically to 13 % after 7 weeks. On the other hand, the immobilized enzyme retained full activity for over 5 weeks, which is very useful for marketing the immobilized enzyme. Similar result was obtained by Ellenrieder et al. (1998) who immobilized naringinase by covalent binding to woodchips and the results showed that the immobilized enzyme retain 100 % of its activity for 30 days. The extended stability of the immobilized form could be attributed to protection of the 3D structure of the enzyme biomacromolecules onto the biopolymer beads.Fig. 7 Shelf stability of free and immobilized naringinase at 4 °C\n\n\n\nThe main advantage of immobilization of enzymes is the easy separation and reusability. The data shown in Fig. 8 indicated that the immobilized naringinase retained over 100 % of its activity after 20 reuses. The retention of the enzyme activity for almost 20 cycles with no loss of activity is a proof that the enzymes were immobilized to the gel beads via covalent bonds. Otherwise, if some enzymes were immobilized via physical bonds, they will not tolerate the reusability test and they would be lost. These results were far better than the one by Ribeiro and Rabaça (2011). The former succeeded in retaining 85 % of the initial activity of immobilized naringinase by cross-linking enzyme aggregates after three cycles; however, the enzyme activity dropped to 18 % by the 6th cycle. The slight decrease in the immobilized enzyme activity by the 20th use using the grafted alginate gel might be attributed to inactivation of enzyme due to continuous use.Fig. 8 Operational stability of immobilized naringinase\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this work, immobilization of naringinase onto grafted alginate beads revealed a significant improvement of the gel’s thermal stability from 200 to 300 °C. The enzyme loading capacity increased gradually to 28-fold of increase after which the carrier reached its saturation with enzymes. The results of optimization of pH values and temperatures were favored for the immobilized form. The shelf and operational stabilities showed outstanding results, retention of 100 % of the immobilized enzyme after 5 weeks and 20 reuses, compared to other authors who achieved only 16 % of the enzyme activity after the 6th use. These results are very useful on the marketing and industrial levels. Further studies could be also carried out to scale up the production of immobilized naringinase for the semi-pilot scale.\n\nThis work was supported by the Chemistry of Natural and Microbial Products

It belongs to enzymes, which have innate properties of reactive radical production, but its utilization in many fields has been ignored because of its unavailability in the commercial field. There are diverse sources of laccase producing organisms like bacteria, fungi and plants. In fungi, laccase is present in Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes, Basidiomycetes and is particularly abundant in many white-rot fungi that degrade lignin. Laccases can degrade both phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. They also have the ability to detoxify a range of environmental pollutants. Due to their property to detoxify a range of pollutants, they have been used for several purposes in many industries including paper, pulp, textile and petrochemical industries. Some other application of laccase includes in food processing industry, medical and health care. Recently, laccase has found applications in other fields such as in the design of biosensors and nanotechnology. The present review provides an overview of biological functions of laccase, its mechanism of action, laccase mediator system, and various biotechnological applications of laccase obtained from endophytic fungi.\n\nKeywords\nLaccaseMechanism of laccase actionLaccase mediator systemEndophytic fungiBiotechnological applicationissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nLaccase is one of the few enzymes that have been the subject of study since the end of the last century. In 1883, laccase was first described by Yoshida when he extracted it from the exudates of the Japanese lacquer tree, Rhus vernicifera (Yoshida 1883). Their characteristic as a metal containing oxidase was discovered by Bertrand (1985). In 1896, both Bertrand and Laborde observed the presence of laccase in fungi for the first time (Desai and Nityanand 2011). Laccase has received lot of attention from researchers due to its ability to degrade a variety of recalcitrant pollutants. Compounds which are structurally similar to lignin can be oxidized (Thurston 1994) by fungal laccase (benzene diol: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) along with ferroxidases (EC 1.16.3.1) and ascorbate oxidase (EC 1.10.3.3) from the family of extranuclear multicopper oxidases (MCOs), which in turn belong to the highly diverse group of blue copper proteins. MCOs typically contain two or four copper atoms per protein molecule and they catalyze oxidation reactions. In these reactions, electrons are removed from the reducing substrate molecules and transferred to oxygen in order to form water without the step of hydrogen peroxide formation (Ducros et al. 1998). Laccases have a wide substrate range, which can serve industrial purposes. The simple requirements of laccase catalysis (presence of substrate and O2), as well as its apparent stability and lack of inhibition (as has been observed with H2O2 for peroxidase), make this enzyme both suitable and attractive for industrial applications. In addition, laccase can oxidize a wide range of organic and inorganic substrates, including mono, di, polyphenols, aminophenols, methoxyphenols as well as metal complexes which are the major reason for their attractiveness for dozens of biotechnological applications.\n\nFungi can survive under marginal living conditions as they produce unusual enzymes capable of performing chemically difficult reactions (Viswanath et al. 2008). Interest in laccases has increased recently because of their potential use in the detoxification of pollutants and in bioremediation of phenolic compounds (Singh et al. 2011). These fungal enzymes can convert jet fuel (Viswanath et al. 2014), paint, plastic and wood among other materials into nutrients. Some enzymes have already been harnessed in pulp and paper processing and in the synthesis of fine chemicals (Viswanath et al. 2008).\n\nMechanism of laccase action\nLaccase only attacks the phenolic subunits of lignin which leads to aryl–alkyl cleavage, Cα oxidation and Cα–Cβ cleavage (Fig. 1a). Laccase catalysis comprises of the following steps:Reduction of the type 1 copper by reducing substrate.\n\nInternal electron transfer from the type 1 to the type 2 and type 3 copper.\n\nReduction of oxygen to water at the types 2 and 3 copper site.\n\nLaccase plays important role in lignin biodegradation but earlier its application was limited to phenolic compounds, because of low oxidation potential of such enzymes (Madhavi and Lele 2009). In the presence of mediator compound such enzymes show higher oxidation capability resulting in numerous biotechnological applications involving oxidation of non-phenolic lignin compounds (Khambhaty et al. 2015) (Fig. 1b).Fig. 1 \na Oxidation of phenolic subunits of lignin by laccase and b oxidation of nonphenolic lignin model compounds by a laccase mediator system (both adapted from Archibald et al. 1997)\n\n\n\nThe laccase mediator system (LMS) was first described by Bourbonnais and Paice (1990) with the use of ABTS [2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)] as the first mediator. It was originally developed to solve the problems in bio-bleaching of wood pulps. The delignification of kraft pulp by laccase can be supported by a number of low molecular mass dyes or aromatic hydrogen donors (Bourbonnais et al. 1995). ABTS was the first mediator found to be effective in the delignification of kraft pulp and lignin transformation by laccase.\n\nThe reaction mechanism mediated by ABTS proceeds as follows.\n\nLaccase is activated by oxygen which then oxidizes the mediator. The mediator then diffuses into pulp and oxidized lignin, which disrupts it into smaller fragments, and hence they are easily removed from the pulp with the help of alkaline extraction. The application of the LMS on hardwood kraft pulp results in demethylation, depolymerization of kraft lignin and reduction of kappa number (Archibald et al. 1997; Reid and Paice 1994).\n\nSome other applications of LMS involve oxidation of aromatic methyl groups, benzyl alcohols (Johannes et al. 1996), bleaching of textile dyes (Rodriguez et al. 2004) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Johannes et al. 1996; Majcherczyk et al. 1998; Johannes and Majcherczyk 2000).\n\nBiotechnological application and biological function of laccases\nLaccase can be found in plants (Dittmer et al. 2004; Shraddha et al. 2011), bacteria (Claus 2003; Abdel-Hamid et al. 2013) and insects (Kramer et al. 2001), but its major source is fungi. The biological function of laccases in fungi is still unclear, but several biological functions such as spore resistance and pigmentation (Aramayo and Timberlake 1993; Williamson et al. 1998), lignification of plant cell walls (Malley et al. 1993), humus turnover, lignin biodegradation and detoxification processes (Baldrian 2006), virulence factors, and copper and iron homeostasis (Stoj and Kosman 2003) have been proposed with a good scientific basis. Physiological function of laccase in plants is the polymerization of monolignols into dimers and trimers during lignification process (Bertrand et al. 2002). They are involved in cell wall formation in plants together with peroxidases. High levels of laccase like multi-copper oxidase (LMCO) expression in plant vascular tissues may reflect the need for high-efficiency iron uptake pumps in tissues that undergo lignifications in Liriodendron tulipifera (Hoopes and Dean 2004). The presence of laccases in resin ducts of anarcardiaceae suggests a rather obvious function, i.e. invasion by bacteria, fungi and defence against herbivores (Mayer and Staples 2002).\n\nHowever, most biotechnologically useful laccases (i.e. those with high redox potentials) are of fungal origin (Thurston 1994). Over 60 fungal strains belonging to Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes show laccase activity. Among the latter group, the lignin-degrading white-rot fungi are the highest producers of laccase (Shraddha et al. 2011) but litter-decomposing and ectomycorrhizal fungi also secret laccases. In the presence of small redox mediators, laccase offers a wide repertoire of oxidations including non-phenolic substrates. Hence, fungal laccases are observed as ideal green catalysts of great biotechnological impact due to their few requirements (they exhibit water as the only by-product and require only air) and their broad substrate specificity, including direct bioelectrocatalysis (Kunamneni et al. 2008).\n\nThe biotechnological applicability of laccase may therefore be extended by the use of laccase-mediator system (LMS). Thus, laccase and LMS find potential application in delignification (Virk et al. 2012), and biobleaching of pulp (Ibarra et al. 2006; Weirick et al. 2014); enzymatic modification of dye-bleaching and fibres in the textile and dye industries (Kunamneni et al. 2008); enzymatic removal of phenolic compounds in beverages—wine and beer stabilization, fruit juice processing (Minussi et al. 2002); enzymatic cross linking of lignin-based materials to produce medium density fibreboards (Widsten et al. 2004); bioremediation and detoxification of aromatic pollutants (Alcalde et al. 2006; Khambhaty et al. 2015); detoxification of lignocellulose hydrolysates for ethanol production by yeast (Larsson et al. 1999); treatment of industrial wastewater (Berrio et al. 2007; Viswanath et al. 2014) and construction of biofuel cells and biosensors (Ghindilis 2000; Shraddha et al. 2011). Due to its catalytical properties, laccase has gained considerable interest for potential biotechnological applicability (Bourbonnais et al. 1995; Abdel-Hamid et al. 2013). Various biotechnological applications of laccase cited in this review paper are represented in Fig. 2 (Table 1).Fig. 2 Application of laccase in biotechnology\n\nTable 1 Biotechnological applications of fungal laccase\n\nS. no.\tSource of laccase\tApplications\tReferences\t\n1.\t\nAspergillus flavus\n\tDecolorization of Malachite green dye\tAli et al.

These fibres can be separated either by degradation and removal of lignin (chemical pulping) or by physically tearing the fibre apart (mechanical pulping). Separation of wood fibres from each other and then processing them into sheets leads to the formation of paper from wood (Madhavi and Lele 2009). Pulp bleaching is currently achieved by treating pulps with chlorine-based chemicals. This results in the formation of chlorinated aliphatic and aromatic compounds that could be carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic (Taspinar and Kolankaya 1998). In the recent years, intensive studies have been performed to develop enzymatic, environmentally benign, bleaching technologies. Biobleaching of pulp has been shown by laccase mediated systems, but the feasibility of its use is hindered by the lack of an inexpensive mediator (Taspinar and Kolankaya 1998).\n\nLaccases can depolymerize lignin and delignify wood pulps (Virk et al. 2012) due to its property of removing potentially toxic phenols arising during degradation of lignin. Firstly laccase acts on small phenolic lignin fragments that react with the lignin polymer, and which then results into its degradation. Moreover, pretreatment of wood chips with ligninolytic fungi increases the pulp strength while energy requirement for mechanical pulping is decreased. Some other uses of laccases for the pulp and paper industry include reduction of the kappa number of pulp (Abdullah et al. 2000; Singhal et al. 2005) and an improvement in the paper making properties of pulp (Kuznetsov et al. 2001). Laccase producing C. albidus was effective in reducing the lignin content of eucalyptus wood and can be used for biopulping in the pulp and paper industry (Singhal et al. 2005). Pretreatment of hardwood with Phlebia tremellosa produced an 80 % increase in the tensile strength. Energy requirement was decreased by 47 % by incubating aspen chips for 4 weeks with Phlebia brevispora. Fungal laccases can be used for the treatment of effluents from pulp mills or from other industries containing chlorolignins or phenolic compounds. Laccases render phenolic compounds less toxic via degradation or polymerization reactions and/or cross-coupling of pollutant phenol with naturally occurring phenols. Laccase base biobleaching process offers an environmentally benign way to improve pulp and paper production.\n\nDye degradation\nThe textile industry accounts for two-thirds of the total dyestuff market and consumes large volumes of water and chemicals for wet processing of textiles (Banat et al. 1996). Textile dyeing effluents containing recalcitrant dyes pollute water due to their color and by the formation of toxic or carcinogenic intermediates such as aromatic amines from azo dyes. The chemical reagents used are very diverse in chemical composition, ranging from inorganic compounds to polymers and organic products (Zollinger 2002). Poots et al. (1976) reported that commercially there are about 1,00,000 available dyes with over 7 × 105 tonnes of dyestuff produced annually. Dyes are usually resistant to fading on exposure to light, water and also to various chemicals due to their complex chemical structure, and most of them are difficult to decolourise due to their synthetic origin (Lin et al. 2010a, b).\n\nSynthetic dyes are extensively used in various industries. The problems related with the release of coloured effluents from different industries such as food, paper, plastics textiles and cosmetics are great concerns for various scientists (Mahmoodi et al. 2009).\n\nSince conventional treatment systems based on chemical or physical methods are quite expensive and consume high amounts of chemicals and energy, alternative technologies for this purpose have recently been studied. Laccase in this field has received particular attention because of its ability to catalyze the oxidation of a wide spectrum of pollutants. A number of anaerobic and aerobic processes have been developed at laboratory scale to treat dyestuff by various researchers. Fungal cultures belonging to white rot fungi have been extensively studied to develop bioprocesses for the mineralization of azo dyes. White-rot fungi are a class of microorganisms that produce efficient enzymes capable of decomposing dyes under aerobic conditions. They produce various oxidoreductases that degrade lignin and related aromatic compounds (Ali 2010; Khan et al. 2013). White rot fungi do not require preconditioning to particular pollutants, because enzyme secretion depends on nutrient limitation, rather than presence of pollutant. Sanghi et al. (2009) studied the potential of white-rot fungal strain Coriolus versicolor to decolorize five structurally different dyes in sequential batch reactors under optimized conditions and the decolourization potential of the fungus was mainly dependent on the nutrients and composition of the medium. Although stable operation of continuous fungal bioreactors for the treatment of synthetic dye solutions has been achieved, application of white rot fungi for the removal of dyes from textile wastewater faces many problems such as large volumes produced, the nature of synthetic dyes, and control of biomass (Elisangel et al. 2009). The ability of a laccase produced by Streptomyces cyaneus to decolourise and detoxify azo dyes was analysed. 90 % colour loss was attained only in the presence of acetosyringone acting as a redox mediator for laccase (Moya et al. 2010). Laccases potential of acting on chromophore compounds such as azo, anthraquinone, heterocyclic, indigoid dyes, polymeric dyes, remazol brilliant blue R, triarylmethane and triphenylmethane leads to the suggestion that they can be applied in industrial decolourization processes (Abdullah et al. 2000). Due to their high specificity, enzymes only attack the dye molecules while valuable dyeing additives or fibers are kept intact and can be reused. Both microorganisms and isolated enzymes have a high potential for the treatment of process effluents in the textile industry to allow their reuse. Currently, there many researchers have optimized dye decolourization using laccase (Fazli et al. 2010; Sharma et al. 2009).\n\nMost existing processes to treat dye wastewater are ineffective and not economical. Hence, fungal decolurization of dye by using laccase can provide an attractive solution due to their potential in degrading dyes of diverse chemical structure including synthetic dyes. This enzyme decolorizes some azo dyes without direct cleavage of the azo bonds through a highly non-specific free radical mechanism, thereby avoiding the formation of toxic aromatic amines (Kalme et al. 2009). Use of fungal biomass to remove colour in dye of industrial effluent is still in research stage and the described system has to be developed with a cheaper biocatalyst that would be cost effective. Thus, laccase based dyes treatment may provide a reasonable basis for the development of biotechnological processes for continuous color and aromatic compounds removal from various industrial effluents at large scale in the industry.\n\nApplication of laccase in bioremediation\nOne of the major problems, besetting the world today, is the contamination of air, soil and water, by harmful chemicals which may have catastrophic impact on human health and environment. The pollution of the environment has become a serious issue with industrialization and immense use of pesticides in agriculture. Around 80 billion pounds of perilous organopollutants are manufactured annually in the US alone and only 10 % of these are disposed of safely (Reddy and Mathew 2001). Stringent regulations have been imposed on industries to treat their waste effluents prior to their final discharge in the environment.\n\nSeveral remediation techniques have been reported during the past two decades, but very few of them have been accepted by some industries. Certain perilous compounds, such as pentachlorophenols (PCP), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) as well as trinitrotoluene (TNT), are persistent in the environment and known to have carcinogenic and/or mutagenic effects. The fungal ability to transmute a vast variety of hazardous chemicals has aroused interest in using them in bioremediation (Bollag et al. 2003). Biological processes have attracted as a viable alternative to the known chemico-physical methods due to their cost, effectiveness and environmental benignity. These processes have potential to mineralize dyes to harmless inorganic compounds like CO2, H2O and the formation of a lesser quantity of sludge (Mohan et al. 2002). Many researchers have demonstrated partial or complete biodegradation of xenobiotics by pure or mixed cultures of endophytic fungi.\n\nIn the early 1980s, researchers had developed the idea of using oxidoreductases for the remediation of water contaminated by aromatic pollutants. Enzymatic remediation has an advantage because these enzymes can act on a broad range of substrates, like phenols, chlorophenols, methylated phenols, bisphenols, anilines, benzidines and other heterocyclic aromatic compounds under dilute conditions and are less sensitive to operational upsets than the microbial populations (Husain and Husain 2008). Enzymatic treatment is currently considered as an alternative method for the removal of toxic xenobiotics from the environment (Marbach et al. 1985). Fungal laccases are used in the decolourization and detoxifications of effluents released from industries, and also help in the treatment of wastewater (Chandra and Chowdhary 2015). They act on both phenolic and nonphenolic lignin-related compounds as well as highly recalcitrant environmental pollutants, and can be effectively used in textile industries, pulp and paper industries, bioremediation and xenobiotic degradation (Viswanath et al. 2014). Potential environmental application for laccases is the bioremediation of contaminated soils as laccases and immobilized laccases are able to oxidize toxic organic pollutants, such as chlorophenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, lignin related structures, organophosphorus compounds, phenols and azo dyes (Leonowicz and Trojanowski 1975; Saratale et al. 2011; Khan et al. 2013).\n\nLaccaseare blue multicopper oxidases, which oxidize or polymerize phenolic compounds to less toxic compounds (Viswanath et al. 2014). Laccase substrates comprise of phenols, dyes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, endocrine disrupters and pesticides, out of which some can be oxidized by extracellular fungal laccase (Majeau et al. 2010). Induction of OH−· production through quinone redox cycling enabled Pleurotus eryngii to oxidize the dye reactive black 5 and phenol, obtaining a high linkup between the rates of pollutant oxidation and OH− production (Gomez-Toribio et al. 2009).\n\nThe biodegradation of a mixture of pentachlorophenol (PCP), 2-chlorophenol (2-CP), 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) using the laccase produced by the white-rot fungal strain Trametes pubescens was evaluated by Gaitan et al. (2011). The laccase potential from the white-rot fungus Marasmius quercophilus to transform certain alkylphenols (p-nonylphenol, p-octylphenol and p–t-octylphenol) was studied by Farnet et al. (2000). The white-rot fungus Trametes vesicolor degraded naproxen in a liquid medium to non-detectable levels after 6 h. In vitro degradation experiments with purified laccase and purified laccase plus mediator 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) showed slight and almost complete naproxen degradation (Marco-Urrea et al. 2010). The detoxification of water soluble fraction named as “alpeorujo” a by-product obtained in olive oil extraction industry by laccase was reported by Saparrat et al. (2010). Zhao et al. (2010) showed that Laccase was responsible for biodegradation of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in soil (Zhao et al. 2010; Chao et al. 2008). Bhattacharya et al. (2009) reported laccase mediated biodegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol and laccase treatment impairs bisphenol-A induced cancer cell proliferation (Bolli et al. 2008). Pozdnyakova et al. (2006) showed the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like anthracene, fluoranthene, fluorene, perylene, phenanthrene and pyrene using laccase produced by Pleurotus ostreatus in the presence of a synthetic mediator.\n\nLaccase is usually studied because of its ability to degrade phenolic compounds in industrial waste water (Gianfreda et al. 1999). Major classes of pollutants are aromatic amines and phenols which are highly regulated in many countries (Karam and Nicell 1997). The presence of such compounds in drinking water, irrigation water or in cultivated land is perilous for health. Laccase immobilization on polyethersulphone showed chemical and physical properties potentially useful for decreasing phenol concentration in a model wastewater treatment (Lante et al. 2000). Crecchio et al. (1995) reported that laccase removes naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds from aqueous suspensions when it is immobilized on organogel supports. Yague et al. (2000) reported that this high tannin containing waste water was degraded by Coriolopsis gallica, a laccase producing white rot fungus.\n\nApplications of laccase in food processing\nLaccases possess great potential to be used as processing aids for the food industry, as food additives in food processing (Osma et al. 2010). Being energy-saving and biodegradable, laccase-based biocatalysts fit well with the development of highly efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly food industries. They are increasingly being used in food industry for production of cost-effective and healthy foods (Brijwani et al. 2010). Laccases catalyzed-oxidation depends on the redox potential of the type-I copper, typically ranging between 500 and 800 mV. However, in presence of mediators, laccases are able to oxidize a wider range of substrates. Owing to the higher redox potential (+800 mV) of fungal laccases compared to plants or bacterial laccases they are implicated in several biotechnological applications related to food processing. Laccases have the potential to make food processing more economical and environmental friendly. To proficiently realize this potential it would require more efficient laccase production systems and better understanding of their mode of action. For instance, redox potentials of laccases from common laccase producing fungi are reported as 450 mV (Myceliophthora thermophila), 750 mV (Pycnoporus cinnabarinus), 780 mV (Botrytis cinerea) and 790 mV (Trametes villosa) (Li et al. 1999). With the use of mediators it is possible to extend the role of laccase to nonphenolic substrates. The versatility of laccase in its action and its wide occurrence in several species of fungi contribute to the easy applicability in biotechnological processes.\n\nIt is well known that browning is one of the major faults in beverages. The susceptibility of browning during storage is increased by laccase treatment (Gokmen et al. 1998). Colour stability is found to be greatly increased in fruit juices after treatment with laccase and active filtration, although turbidity is present. After treatment with laccase, the phenolic content of juices has been found to be greatly reduced along with an increase in colour stability (Ribeiro et al. 2010).\n\nIn the bread making process, it is a practice to add dough improvement additives to the bread dough, which results in improved flavor, texture, volume, and freshness of the bread/dough. Laccase exerts an oxidizing effect on the constituents of dough which then improves the strength of gluten structures in baked products. Use of laccase in dough results in an improved crumb structure, an increased volume, stability, strength, softness of the baked product and reduced stickiness. Laccase reduces the dough extensibility in both flour and gluten dough, as well as increases the resistance of dough to its maximum (Selinheimo et al. 2006). The addition of laccase to oat flour leads to an increased loaf specific volume and addition of proteolytic enzymes to it, simultaneously crumb hardness and chewiness is reduced which results to significant improvement to texture quality of oat bread.\n\nJurado et al. (2009) reported that the phenolic compounds are reduced by the induction of laccase, which act as inhibitor of fermentation and increases the production of ethanol from steam exploded wheat straw. Laccase expressing yeast strains showed a definite advantage for producing ethanol from lignocelluloses because it enabled faster growth and ethanol formation as it had the ability to convert coniferyl aldehyde at a very fast rate (Larsson et al. 1999).\n\nLaccase is commonly used to stabilize fruit juices. Naturally occurring phenolics and their oxidation products are found to be present in many fruit juices, which add color and taste to it. The natural co-oxidation reactions and polymerization of phenols and polyphenols result in undesirable changes in aroma and color. The color change is observed as enzymatic darkening, which increases due to a higher concentration of polyphenols naturally present in fruit juices (Ribeiro et al. 2010). Research by Giovanelli and Ravasini (1993) utilized laccase in combination with filtration in the stabilization of apple juice. Laccase treatment causes removal of phenols with higher efficiency compared to other methods, like activated coals (Brijwani et al. 2010). The removal of substrate–enzyme complex is done by membrane filtration. Color stability was found to be greatly increased after treatment with laccase and active filtration, while turbidity was present. Ribeiro et al. (2010) reported that the phenolic content of juices was found to be greatly reduced after treatment with laccase along with an increase in color stability. Compared to conventional treatments, such as addition of ascorbic acid and sulphites laccase treatment has also been found to be more effective for color and flavor stability (Minussi et al. 2002).\n\nThe use of laccase enzymes allows for the improvement of functionality along with sensory properties. The successful application of laccases in food processing would require production of high amounts at low-cost. Many production strategies can be adopted along with media and process optimization to achieve better process economics. Media optimization and use of appropriate inducers could bring additional benefits of higher production with expenditure of minimum resources. Both submerged and solid state cultivation techniques have been embraced by the researchers for laccase production. Submerged fermentation, though, leads the SSF for industrial production of laccase. Future efforts in improving the SSF bioreactor designs can make SSF more potent and competitive. Laccase have important role to play in green food-based processing including beverage (fruit juice, wine and beer) stabilization, role in improvement of overall food quality, uses in baking industry and bioremediation. Ligninolytic fungi and their enzymes exhibited several biophysics and biochemical characteristics that have been applied in the delignification and detoxification of biofuel feedstocks. Ligninolytic processes (enzymatic and fungal) produce ethanol yield, glucose conversion, and delignification and detoxification percentages similar or superior than conventional detoxification and delignification methodologies (Plácido and Capareda. 2015). It is clear from the survey of literature that focus has been on a few laccase producing endophytic fungi, but there are still large numbers of fungi not yet exploited for laccase production. Search and screening of unexplored fungal species along with known and reference cultures is required to select potential cultures producing laccase in larger amounts. Further understanding of kinetic parameters of laccases will be useful for practical applications of the enzyme.\n\nMedical and personal care application\nMany products generated by laccases are antimicrobial, detoxifying, or active personal-care agents. Due to their specificity and bio-based nature, potential applications of laccases in the field are attracting active research efforts. Laccase can be used in the synthesis of complex medical compounds as anesthetics, anti-inflammatory, antibiotics, sedatives, etc., including triazolo(benzo)cycloalkyl thiadiazines, vinblastine, mitomycin, penicillin X dimer, cephalosporins, and dimerized vindoline.\n\nPoison ivy dermatitis is caused mainly by urushiol, which is a catechol derivative toxin. Laccase oxidizes, detoxifies and polymerizes urushiol (Cheong et al. 2010), which reduces the effect of poison ivy dermatitis (oxidized urushiol is non-toxic). Laccase can oxidize iodide to produce iodine which is widely used as a disinfectant. It has several advantages over direct iodine application. In terms of handling, storage and transport, Iodide salt is more stable and much safer as compared to iodine. Release of iodine from a laccase iodide system could be easily controlled. The system may be used in several medical, industrial, domestic, and other personal care applications. A novel application field for laccases is in cosmetics. For example, laccase-based hair dyes could be less irritant and easier to handle than current hair dyes. Couto and Herrera (2006) reported that laccase based system may overcome drawbacks of chemical dyes by replacing hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizing agent in the dyeing formula. More recently, cosmetic and dermatological preparations containing proteins for skin lightening have also been developed. Laccases may find use as deodorants for personal-hygiene products, including toothpaste, mouthwash, detergent, soap, and diapers. Protein engineered laccase may also be used to reduce allergenicity.\n\nThe synthesis of immunomodulatory prostaglandins by the use of laccase was reported by Erb-Downward et al. (2008). Proliferation of murine leukemia cell line L1210 and human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was inhibited by laccase isolated from Pleurotus cornucopiae, and the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC50 of 22 μM was reduced. Wong et al. (2010) reported that there was neither mitogenic activity towards mouse splenocytes nor hemagglutinating/hemolytic activity toward rabbit erythrocytes. Inhibition of hepatitis C virus entry into peripheral blood cells and hepatoma cells by laccase purified from oyster mushroom (El-Fakharany et al. 2010). From the fresh fruiting bodies of the edible white common Agrocybe cylindracea mushroom (Hu et al. 2011), a laccase, with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor activity and antiproliferative activity against HepG2 and MCF7 cells was isolated.\n\nNanobiotechnology and biosensor\nLaccase (EC 1.10.3.2, p-benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase) catalyzes the oxidation of various aromatic compounds, particularly phenols, which are organic pollutants, present in wastewater. With this specific function, this enzyme has a great impact on the development of biosensors for both environmentally important pollutants and clinically relevant metabolites. Laccases are able to catalyse electron transfer reactions without additional cofactors. In Biosensor technology the use of laccase is mainly attributed to its broad substrate range allowing for the detection of a broad range of phenolics, oxygen or azides; this does however disallow the detection of specific constituents (Fogel and Limson 2013). Biosensors that utilize laccase include an electrode that may be used for the detection of phenols, such as catechols in tea (Palmore and Kim 1999) and real water samples (Li et al. 2014), polyphenolic compounds in wine (Lanzellotto et al. 2014), and lignins and phenols in wastewaters (Giovanelli and Ravasini 1993). Nanostructured enzyme-based biosensor on fullerene and gold nanoparticles was performed evaluating the detection of polyphenols either in buffer solution or in real wine samples (Lanzellotto et al. 2014). Lin et al. (2010a, b) reported a non-oxidative electrochemical approach to online measurements of dopamine release through laccase-catalyzed oxidation and intramolecular cyclization of dopamine. Polyphenol index in wines is determined by laccase coupled multi-walled carbon nano tubes based biosensor. This biosensor shows reliable and fast amperometric responses to gallic acid (Di Fusco et al. 2010). Ultrasensitive amperometric detection of the catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine is achieved by an enzyme electrode based on the co-immobilisation of an osmium redox polymer and a laccase on glassy carbon electrodes, attaining nanomolar detection limits (Ferry and Leech 2005). For the immobilization of laccase, the hybrid material of nafion/sol–gel silicate has altered the selectivity of the enzyme to various phenolic compounds such as catechol, guaiacol, m-cresol and o-cresol (Abdullah et al. 2007). Franzoi et al. (2009) reported laccase based biosensor for determination of rosmarinic acid in plant extracts.\n\nConclusion\nLaccases are receiving much attention from researchers around the globe because of their specific nature. They have many industrial applications because of their innate ability of oxidation of a broad range of phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. The biotechnological significance of laccase enzymes has led to a drastic increase in the demand for these enzymes in the recent time. Laccase are promising to replace the conventional chemical processes of several industries. The introduction of the laccase-mediator system provides a biological alternative to traditional chlorine bleaching processes.\n\nOne of the limitations to the large-scale application of the enzyme is the lack of capacity to produce large volumes of highly active enzyme. These problems can be solved with the use of recombinant organisms or screening for natural hypersecretory strains. Environmental factors influence the ability of fungi to produce high titres of laccase, and different strains react differently to these conditions. One should thus select a strain capable of producing high concentrations of a suitable enzyme and then optimize conditions for laccase production by the selected organism. The effective catalytic properties of enzymes have already promoted their introduction into several industrial products and processes. Recent developments in biotechnology, particularly in areas such as protein engineering and directed evolution, have provided important tools for the efficient development of new enzymes.

Here, we characterize 20 Moroccan and 19 exotic bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars using 47 functional and 7 linked random DNA markers associated with 21 loci of the most important traits for wheat breeding. The functional marker analysis revealed that 35, 45, and 10 % of the Moroccan cultivars, respectively have the rust resistance genes (Lr34/Yr18/Pm38), dwarfing genes (Rht1b or Rht2b alleles) and the leaf rust resistance gene (Lr68). The marker alleles for genes Lr37/Yr17/Sr38, Sr24 and Yr36 were present only in the exotic cultivars and absent in Moroccan cultivars. 25 % of cultivars had 1BL.1RS translocation. 70 % of the wheat cultivars had Ppo-D1a and Ppo-A1b associated with low polyphenol oxidase activity. 10 % of cultivars showed presence of a random DNA marker allele (175 bp) linked to Hessian fly resistance gene H22. The majority of the Moroccan cultivars were carrying alleles that impart good bread making quality. Neighbor joining (NJ) and principal coordinate analysis based on the marker data revealed a clear differentiation between elite Moroccan and exotic wheat cultivars. The results of this study are useful for selecting suitable parents for making targeted crosses in marker-assisted wheat breeding and enhancing genetic diversity in the wheat cultivars.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-016-0413-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords\nGenetic diversityFunctional markersLinked random DNAAgronomic traitsBread wheatissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important staple crop, providing 20 % of all calories consumed by people worldwide. Demand for wheat is predicted to increase in the future as the global population increases. With the world’s population estimated to reach 9.6 billion by 2050, wheat production will have a crucial bearing on food security and the global economy in the coming decades. In Morocco, wheat is the most consumed cereal crop, with a per capita consumption of 258 kg annually (USDA Foreign Agricultural Service 2014). In Morocco, it is cultivated in an area of 3.2 million ha, mostly in rainfed conditions with a production of 6.9 million tonnes in 2013 (FAOSTAT 2014). Its productivity is comparatively low, due to abiotic stresses such as drought, and biotic stresses such as Hessian fly, leaf rust, and yellow rust. Consequently, Morocco is not self sufficient in wheat production in most of the years and imports bread wheat for its domestic consumption. Therefore, the overall objectives of wheat breeding remains the development of wheat genotypes with higher yield, higher adapted to contrasted environment, resistance to the biotic stresses and with acceptable higher grain quality. Even all the effort made for improving wheat, its productivity still depends on traditional breeding and selection using conventional techniques. Currently, the Moroccan breeding program is giving a priority to new technologies such as the use of molecular markers to speed up the development of improved wheat varieties.\n\nThe characterization of genetic variability and an estimate of the genetic relationship among varieties are essential to any breeding program; because of artificial crosses among less similar parents allow a larger segregation and the combination of different favorable alleles (Bered et al. 2002). Genetic similarities might be evaluated by means of pedigree analysis (Barrett and Kidwell 1998) or by assessing morphological traits (Schut et al. 1997) as well as biochemical (Metakovsky and Branlard 1998) or, more recently, DNA markers (Barrett and Kidwell 1998; Pagnotta et al. 2005). The use of molecular approaches, particularly molecular markers, has allowed better characterization, maintenance of genetic variation in plant germplasm, identifying genes underlying important traits, and devising optimal breeding strategies for crop improvement (Hayden et al. 2010). Therefore, evaluation of the genetic diversity present in wheat germplasm deployed in the current breeding programs at the molecular level and integration of this information into cultivar development are essential for using genetic resources effectively in breeding programs (Chao et al. 2007).\n\nIdentification of molecular markers that cosegregate or closely linked with the agronomic traits is useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS; Mohan et al. 1997). Closely linked random DNA markers (RDMs; Andersen and Lubberstedt 2003) and gene specific or functional markers (Andersen and Lubberstedt 2003) are commonly used for MAS. In contrast to random DNA markers, gene specific or functional markers are ideal for MAS in wheat breeding as they are derived directly from the gene conferring the phenotype. In plant breeding, functional markers can be used for validation of cultivar identity, selection of parental materials to build segregating population, and subsequent selection of lines (Lübberstedt et al. 2005). Several markers were developed and validated for MAS. To date, more than 30 wheat loci associated with end-use quality, agronomic traits, and disease resistance in bread wheat (Liu et al. 2012). 56 functional markers for quality traits such as high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS and LMW-GS), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, lipoxynase (LOX) activity, yellow pigment content (YPC), kernel hardness (Pin), and starch properties have been developed. 27 functional markers for agronomic traits were developed and reportedly used in wheat breeding programs such as semi-dwarfing genes Rht-B1b (Rht1) and Rht-D1b (Rht2), photoperiod response genes (Ppd), vernalization genes (Vrn) and developmental rate genes. For rust disease resistance, six genes Lr34/Yr18/Pm38, Lr37/Yr17/Sr38, Lr19, Lr47, Lr51 and Yr36 had been cloned in wheat (Feuillet et al. 2003; Huang et al. 2003; Yahiaoui et al. 2004; Fu et al. 2009; Krattinger et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2014) in addition to 1B/1R translocation (Froidmont 1998; Chai et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2008) and functional markers were designed and successfully applied in the breeding. The objective of this work was to genotype 20 Moroccan and 19 exotic bread wheat cultivars using 47 functional markers and 7 random DNA markers closely linked to 21 loci of the most important target traits for breeding and to determine the genetic relationship between them to identify the potential parental lines for the wheat breeding programs.\n\nMaterials and methods\nPlant materials\nA set of 39 wheat lines, which includes 20 improved elite cultivars of Morocco and 19 exotic cultivars (Table 1) were used for the marker analysis. The exotic wheat lines were introduced to Morocco to be used as donors for the specific traits of interest in the wheat breeding program. The Moroccan cultivars were procured from the National Gene Bank of Morocco, whereas, the exotic cultivars were procured from the national or international gene banks of the other countries.Table 1 Cultivar name and pedigree of Moroccan and the exotic bread wheat used in this study\n\nCultivar\tOrigin\tPedigreea\n\t\nSaïs\tMorocco\tTob’s’/1/NP/2/CC/Inia/3/Cha\t\nArrehane\tMorocco\tL222 introduced from USA\t\nAcsad-59\tMorocco\tSelection from Arab Center for the studies of arid zones and dry lands (ACSAD) nursery\t\nKanz\tMorocco\tPavon’s’/4/Pato (R)/1/Cal/3/7C/2/Bb/Cno\t\nAguilal\tMorocco\tSaïs*2/1/KS-85-14-2\t\nTilila\tMorocco\tVeery ‘s’\t\nAchtar\tMorocco\tHork/1/Ymh/2/Kal/1/Bb\t\nNasma\tMorocco\tMoroccan selection\t\nKhair\tMorocco\tMaya/2/LR64/1/LR64/3/TZPP/1/Y54/2/23584\t\nMassira\tMorocco\tL2266/1/1406,101/2/Buc’s’/3/Vpm/1/Mos 83,11,4,8/2/Nac\t\nMehdia\tMorocco\tKauz’S’\t\nRajae\tMorocco\tMor’s’/1/Mon’s’\t\nAmal\tMorocco\tBow’s’/1/Buc’s’\t\nBaraka\tMorocco\tVent71/2/Cno67’s’/1/SC66/3/Kal/1/Bb (=Pavon)\t\nJouda\tMorocco\tKal/1/blue bird\t\nSaba\tMorocco\tNasma/1/PotamPRL/2*PASTOR\t\nMarchouch\tMorocco\tKal/1/Ciano/2/81562/3/BT908\t\nPotam\tMorocco\tSelection from CIMMYT nursery\t\nSaada\tMorocco\tButte/2/Arthur/1/Butte\t\nSalama\tMorocco\tIntroduced from Europe by SONACOS, Morocco\t\nYecora Rojo-Gpc-B1/Yr36\tUSA\tFa-15-3(Tr.Ds,Isr)/7*Yecora Rojo\t\nPavon-76\tMexico\tVicam-71//Ciano-67/Siete-Cerros-66/3/Kalyansona/Bluebird\t\nParula\tMexico\tFrontana/Kenya-58//Newthatch/3/2*Frocor//Kenya-Ad/Gabo-54/4/Bluebird/Chanate;Frontana/Kenya-58//Newthatch/3/2*Frontana//Kenya-350/Gabo-55/4/Bluebird/Chanat\t\nOpata-85\tMexico\tBluejay(Sib)/Jupateco-73\t\nDharwar Dry\tIndia\t–\t\nStylet\tAustralia\tMolineux/2*Trident\t\nAnnuello\tAustralia\tPavon(Sib)/Tm-56(Vf-665)//Janz\t\nChinese Spring\tChina\tOld accession\t\nLew\tUSA\tFortuna, Usa/S-6285\t\nSumai-3\tChina\tFuno/Taiwan-Xiaomai; Jingzhou/Sumai-2; Funo/Taiwanmai\t\nBobwhite-S\tMexico\tAvrora//Kalyansona/Bluebird/3/(Sib)Woodpecker\t\nRampart\tUSA\tLew/Tiber//Redwin\t\nVeranopolis\tBrazil\tTrintecinco/Frontana\t\nVeery\tMexico\tKavkaz/Buho//Kalyansona/Bluebird\t\nFrontana\tBrazil\tFronteira/Mentana\t\nLargo\tUSA\tLangdon (Tr.Dr)/(Tr.Ta)Pi-268210; Langdon (Tr.Dr)/(Tr.Ta)Pi-268219\t\nExperiment Station-88\tBulgaria\tBulgarian-88\t\nTadinia\tUSA\tTadorna(W)/Inia-66\t\nTurksikum\tAzerbaijan\tPI262660\t\n\naThe nomenclature described in Skovmand et al.

(1984) with some modifications as adapted by Udupa et al. (1999). Fresh young leaves were collected from green house grown plants of individual cultivars. The isolated DNA was estimated both qualitatively and quantitatively using 1.0 % (w/v) agarose gels by comparing bands to known concentrations of lambda DNA.\n\nTotal of 47 functional markers and 7 linked random DNA markers (RDMs) to the traits of interest were used for genotyping the bread wheat cultivars. They were Lr34 (Lagudah et al. 2006), Lr68 (Herrera-Foessel et al. 2012), Lr37 (Helguera et al. 2003), Sr24 (Mago et al. 2005), Gpc-B1/Yr36 (Distelfeld et al. 2006), Rht-B1, Rht-D1 (Ellis et al. 2002), Vp1-B3 (Yang et al. 2007), Ppo-A1, Ppo-D1 (He et al. 2007), Ppd-D1 (Beales et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2009), iag95 for 1B/1R (Mago et al. 2002), Pina-D1 (Gautier et al. 1994), Allwaxy (McLauchlan et al. 2001), Glu-A1 (Lafiandra et al. 1997; De Bustos et al. 2000), Glu-B1 (Ahmad 2000; Butow et al. 2004; Lei et al. 2006), Glu-D1 (Ahmad 2000), Glu-A3 (Zhang et al. 2004), Glu-B3 (Wang et al. 2009), Glu-D3 (Zhao et al. 2007) and Xgdm33, closely linked to gene H22 (Zhao et al. 2006). PCR reaction was performed in a reaction volume of 10 μL containing 1× PCR buffer (1.5 mM MgCl2), 200 µM of each dNTPs, 10 pmol of each primer, 0.5U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and approximately 50 ng of genomic DNA. Primers names, sequences and cycling conditions for each molecular marker are detailed in supplementary Table S1. The PCR products were separated 1.2 or 1.5 % (w/v) agarose gels. Except for Allwaxy, Rht-B1, Rht-D1 and Xgdm33 were run in 6 % native polyacrylamide gels, prepared in a vertical electrophoresis unit (CBS Scientific) using 0.5 × TBE buffer. The different gels were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.\n\nAnalysis of molecular data\nPowerMarker software version 3.25 (Liu and Muse 2005) was used to calculate the number of alleles and values of genetic diversity and PIC (Botstein et al. 1980) of each locus. Genetic distances between each pair of cultivars were measured by calculating the shared allele frequencies (Jin and Chakraborty 1993). The Neighbor joining dendrogram was generated using the DARwin software based on the genetic distance calculated using PowerMarker software. The genetic structure was analyzed by performing PCoA (Principal Coordinates analysis) implemented in the program GenAlex 6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2012).\n\nResults\nGenetic diversity analysis\nGenetic diversity of 20 elite Moroccan cultivars and 19 potential exotic cultivars to be deployed in the breeding program was evaluated using 47 functional and 7 random DNA markers linked to the target traits of interest. The total number of detected alleles was 48 in Moroccan cultivars and 56 in exotic cultivars. Average number of alleles was slightly higher in exotic cultivars than Moroccan cultivars. Mean number of alleles was 2.5 and 2.9 in Moroccan and exotic cultivars, respectively. Similarly, exotic cultivars had a higher PIC value (0.39) compared to Moroccan cultivars (0.34) (Table 2). The 54 primer pairs for specific alleles linked to 21 loci distributed in 12 chromosomes showed a good polymorphism in Moroccan cultivars with slight difference to the exotic cultivars. The genetic diversity calculated was 0.4. The glutenin genes namely Glu-B1, Glu-A3 and Glu-B3 were the most polymorphic and displayed higher number of alleles (5, 5 and 6) and high genetic diversity (0.735, 0.660 and 0.770), respectively.Table 2 Major allele frequency, number of alleles, genetic diversity and PIC at functional and random DNA markers linked to end-use quality, agronomic traits, and biotic stresses resistance in Moroccan and the exotic bread wheat cultivars\n\nMarker\tChromosome\tMoroccan cultivars\tExotic cultivars\t\nSample size\tNo. of alleles\tGene diversity\tPIC\tSample size\tNo. of alleles\tGene diversity\tPIC\t\n\nLr34/Yr18/Pm38\n\t7D\t20\t2\t0.455\t0.351\t19\t2\t0.487\t0.368\t\n\nRht-B1 (Rht1) \n\t4B\t20\t2\t0.495\t0.372\t19\t2\t0.432\t0.400\t\n\nRht-D1 (Rht2)\n\t4D\t20\t2\t0.495\t0.372\t19\t2\t0.265\t0.231\t\n\niag95\n\t1B/1R\t20\t2\t0.420\t0.332\t19\t2\t0.188\t0.170\t\n\nPina- D1\n\t5D\t20\t2\t0.375\t0.305\t19\t2\t0.487\t0.368\t\n\nWx-A1\n\t1A\t20\t2\t0.420\t0.332\t19\t2\t0.100\t0.094\t\n\nWx-B1\n\t4A\t20\t2\t0.375\t0.305\t19\t2\t0.332\t0.277\t\n\nPpd-D1\n\t2D\t20\t2\t0.255\t0.222\t19\t2\t0.487\t0.368\t\n\nVp1-B3\n\t3B\t20\t1\t0.000\t0.000\t19\t3\t0.460\t0.392\t\n\nLr68\n\t7B\t20\t2\t0.180\t0.164\t19\t2\t0.188\t0.171\t\n\nPpo-D1\n\t2D\t20\t2\t0.420\t0.332\t19\t2\t0.432\t0.338\t\n\nPpo-A1\n\t2A\t20\t2\t0.420\t0.332\t19\t2\t0.387\t0.312\t\n\nXgdm33-H22\n\t1D\t20\t2\t0.255\t0.222\t19\t2\t0.332\t0.277\t\n\nGlu-A1\n\t1A\t20\t3\t0.555\t0.491\t15\t3\t0.638\t0.561\t\n\nGlu-B1\n\t1B\t20\t5\t0.735\t0.690\t19\t5\t0.714\t0.664\t\n\nGlu-D1\n\t1D\t20\t2\t0.255\t0.222\t15\t3\t0.560\t0.461\t\n\nGlu-A3\n\t1A\t20\t5\t0.660\t0.611\t19\t7\t0.800\t0.770\t\n\nGlu-B3\n\t1B\t17\t6\t0.770\t0.736\t17\t8\t0.844\t0.825\t\n\nGlu-D3\n\t1D\t20\t2\t0.095\t0.090\t15\t3\t0.417\t0.369\t\nTotal\t\t\t48\t\t\t\t56\t\t\t\nMean\t\t\t2.526\t0.402\t0.341\t\t2.947\t0.450\t0.387\t\nSD (±)\t\t\t1.307\t0.201\t0.187\t\t1.779\t0.200\t0.195\t\n\n\nMarkers based trait analysis\nThe 20 elite Moroccan cultivars were screened with the functional and the random DNA markers linked with quality, agronomic traits, and disease resistance (Table 3). The frequency of leaf rust resistance functional allele at Lr34 gene was 35 % and at Lr68 gene the linked random DNA marker allele was 10 % (Table 3). The marker alleles for genes Lr37, Sr24 and Yr36 were absent in Moroccan cultivars, whereas they were present only in exotic cultivars. 25 % of cultivars had 1R segment (1BL.1RS translocation) and 10 % of cultivars showed presence of 175 bp size allele of Xgdm33 linked with Hessian fly resistance gene H22. For the other agronomic traits, such as, dwarfing genes Rht1 and Rht2, the frequency was 45 % for each gene. Majority of wheat cultivars had Ppo-D1a and Ppo-A1b alleles associated with low polyphenol oxidase activity (70 %). Only 15 % of the cultivars had photoperiod insensitive allele at Ppd-D1 locus. While, Vp1-B3 STS primer pair amplified 569 bp fragment linked to preharvest sprouting tolerance in all 20 Moroccan cultivars. For the end-use quality traits, the frequency of wx-A1 and wx-B1 associated to improved starch quality was 70 and 75 %, respectively. In addition, wx-D1 (data not shown) existed in all Moroccan and exotic cultivars. Twenty-five percent of cultivars carried Pina-D1a linked to soft grain texture. The Glutenin genes revealed high level of polymorphism related to variable degree of bread making quality.Table 3 Moroccan and exotic cultivars showing presence of important genes/traits of interest to wheat breeding based on analysis of the functional and random DNA markers linked to the agronomic traits\n\nLocus\tType of marker\tInteresting allele designation/size in bp\tAllele frequency (%)\tCultivars\t\n\nLr34/Yr18/Pm38\n\tFunctional\t150 bp\t35\tMoroccan cultivars: Arrehane, Acsad-59, Massira, Mehdia, Baraka, Jouda and Saada\t\n\t\t\t42\tExotic cultivars: Parula, Opata-85, Dharwar Dry, Annuello, Chinese Spring, Sumai-3, Veranopolis and Frontana\t\n\nRht-B1 (Rht1)\tFunctional\t\nRht-B1b (237 bp)\t45\tMoroccan cultivars: Arrehane, Acsad-59, Tilila, Achtar, Khair, Massira, Mehdia, Baraka and Jouda\t\n\t\t\t37\tExotic cultivars: Yecora Rojo-Gpc-B1/Yr36, Dharwar Dry, Opata-85, Annuello, Bobwhite-S, Veery and Tadinia\t\n\nRht-D1 (Rht2)\tFunctional\t\nRht-D1b (254 bp)\t45\tMoroccan cultivars: Saïs, Kanz, Aguilal, Nasma, Rajae, Amal, Marchouch, Potam and Salama\t\n\t\t\t16\tExotic cultivars: Yecora Rojo-Gpc-B1/Yr36, Pavon-76 and Stylet\t\n\niag95 (1BL/1RS)\tClosely linked\t1.1 kb\t25\tMoroccan cultivars: Tilila, Mehdia, Rajae, Amal and Salama\t\n\t\t\t11\tExotic cultivars: Bobwhite-S and Veery\t\n\nPina-D1 (Softness)\tFunctional\t\nPina-D1a (330 bp)\t25\tMoroccan cultivars: Saïs, Acsad-59, Aguilal, Massira and Potam\t\n\t\t\t58\tExotic cultivars: Stylet, Annuello, Chinese Spring, Lew, Sumai-3, Rampart, Veranopolis, Frontana, Largo, Experiment Station-88 and Turksikum\t\n\nWx-A1\n\tFunctional\t257 bp\t70\tMoroccan cultivars: Saïs, Arrehane, Aguilal, Tilila, Nasma, Khair, Massira, Amal, Baraka, Saba, Marchouch, Potam, Saada and Salama\t\n\t\t\t95\tExotic cultivars: Yecora Rojo-Gpc-B1/Yr36, Parula, Opata-85, Dharwar Dry, Stylet, Annello, Chinese Spring, Lew, Sumai-3, Bobwhite-S, Rampart, Veranopolis, Veery, Frontana, Largo, Experiment Station-88, Tadinia and Turksikum\t\n\nWx-B1\n\tFunctional\t227 bp\t75\tMoroccan cultivars: Saïs, Acsad-59, Kanz, Aguilal, Tilila, Nasma, Khair, Mehdia, Rajae, Amal, Saba, Marchouch, Potam, Saada and Salama\t\n\t\t\t79\tExotic cultivars: Yecora Rojo-Gpc-B1/Yr36, Parula, Opata-85, Dharwar Dry, Chinese Spring, Lew, Sumai-3, Bobwhite-S, Rampart, Veranopolis, Veery, Largo, Experiment Station-88, Tadinia and Turksikum\t\n\nPpd-D1\n\tFunctional\t\nPpd-D1a (414 bp)\t15\tMoroccan cultivars: Nasma, Saba and Saada\t\n\t\t\t42\tExotic cultivars: Dharwar Dry, Stylet, Chinese Spring, Lew, Rampart, Largo, Experiment Station-88 and Turksikum\t\n\nVp1-B3\n\tFunctional\t569 bp\t100\tMoroccan cultivars: All cultivars studied\t\n\t\t\t74\tExotic cultivars: Yecora Rojo-Gpc-B1/Yr36, Pavon-76, Parula, Opata-85, Dharwar Dry, Stylet, Annuello, Chinese Spring, Lew, Sumai-3, Bobwhite-S, Rampart, Veery and Largo\t\n\nLr68\n\tClosely linked\t385 bp\t10\tMoroccan cultivars: Saada and Salama\t\n\t\t\t10\tExotic cultivars: Parula and Frontana\t\n\nPpo-D1\n\tFunctional\t\nPpo-D1a (730 bp for PPO16 and Null for PPO29)\t70\tMoroccan cultivars: Arrehane, Acsad-59, Kanz, Tilila, Achtar, Nasma, Khair, Massira, Rajae, Amal, Baraka, Marchouch, Saada, Salama\t\n\t\t\t68\tExotic cultivars: Pavon-76, Parula, Opata-85, Dharwar Dry, Annuello, Chinese Spring, Sumai-3, Bobwhite-S, Veranopolis, Frontana, Largo, Experiment Station-88 and Turksikum\t\n\nPpo-A1\n\tFunctional\t\nPpo-A1b (685 bp for PPO18 and 290 bp for PPO33)\t70\tMoroccan cultivars: Achtar, Nasma, Massira, Rajae, Amal and Marchouch\t\n\t\t\t26\tExotic cultivars: Opata-85, Chinese Spring, Sumai-3, Bobwhite-S and Veery\t\n\nH22\n\tLinked\t175 bp\t10\tMoroccan cultivars: Arrehane and Aguilal\t\n\t\t\t 0 \tExotic cultivars: Nill\t\n\n\nGenetic relationships and PCoA analysis\nTo study the genetic relationships between Moroccan and exotic cultivars for breeding purposes, the allelic data were used to estimate the genetic distance between all cultivars and Neighbor joining dendrogram was generated (Fig. 1). All cultivars were clustered into three major groups (G-I, G-II and G-III). In each group, the Moroccan and exotic cultivars were mainly separated into subgroups. However, Mexican cultivars Pavon-76, Veery and Opata-85 and an Australian cultivar Annuello were grouped with Moroccan cultivars. The most divergent pair was Chinese Spring and Moroccan cultivars Jouda, Mehdia and Saïs, which exhibited highest genetic distance (0.74). The two Moroccan cultivars Aguilal and Saïs were genetically close (0.11). Similarly, genetic distance between exotic cultivars Frontana and Veranopolis were smallest (0.11).Fig. 1 The Neighbor joining dendrogram generated based on shared allele genetic distance among 20 Moroccan cultivars and 19 exotic cultivars (names underlined) of bread wheat. All the cultivars were clustered into three major groups (G-I, G-II and G-III)\n\n\n\nThe genetic structure was analyzed using principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). The PCoA of genetic distance between genotypes, based on gene frequencies revealed differentiation between cultivars. The three axes explained 16.38, 13.39 and 9.61 % of the total variance, and separated the cultivars into two clusters, Moroccan cultivars in one cluster and exotic cultivars in another cluster (Fig. 2), except, the exotic Mexican cultivars Pavon-76, Veery and Bobwhite and the American cultivars Yecora Rojo-Gpc-B1/Yr36 were grouped with the Moroccan cluster.Fig. 2 Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot generated from genetic distance calculations using the GENALEX package for 20 Moroccan cultivars (marked in square) and 19 exotic cultivars (marked in diamond) of bread wheat\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe Moroccan wheat cultivars used in this study represent the most advanced breeding lines released for cultivation in Morocco and encompass important gene pools adapted to Morocco and the North Africa region. Therefore, information of genetic diversity, identification of specific alleles, genes or loci and assessment of the genetic relationships among these cultivars can provide relevant guidelines in selecting parents and for designing new breeding strategies for wheat cultivar improvement, especially, against leaf rust, yellow rust and Hessian fly, which are considered as most destructive biotic stresses in Morocco (Elhaddoury et al. 2012). Lombardi et al. (2014) reported that selection of divergent parental genotypes for breeding should be made actively on the basis of systematic assessment of genetic distance between genotypes, rather than passively based on geographical distance.\n\nThe total number of alleles detected at 21 loci was 48 alleles in Moroccan cultivars (mean 2.5 alleles) and 56 alleles in the exotic cultivars (mean 2.9 alleles). The PIC value was 0.34 for Moroccan cultivars and 0.39 for exotic cultivars. Similar studies have been conducted by Vanzetti et al. (2013) for 102 Argentinean bread wheat cultivars and reported an average number of alleles and PIC values of 3.26 and 0.458, respectively. In India, Malik et al. (2013) characterized 48 elite Indian wheat genotypes and reported 2.42 alleles per locus and 0.4596 PIC value.\n\nThe functional markers and the random DNA markers linked to the target traits such as the rust resistance (Lr34, Lr68, Lr37, Yr36 and Sr24), Hessian fly resistance (H22), 1BL/1RS translocation, growth photoperiod sensitivity (Ppd-D1), plant height (Rht-B1, Rht-D1), grain texture (Pina-D1), starch waxy proteins variants (Wx-A1, Wx-B1), PPO activity (Ppo-A1, Ppo-D1), pre-harvest sprouting tolerance (Vp1-B3), high molecular weight glutenins (Glu-A1, Glu-B1, Glu-D1) and low molecular weight glutenins (Glu-A3, Glu-B3, Glu-D3) shown to be ideal for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. The information generated in this study is also useful for selection of parental materials to develop segregating population for marker-assisted selection. The use of gene specific markers permitted to know the genetic structure of Moroccan modern wheat cultivars. The functional alleles of some of these traits were very well related to the respective phenotypes of the cultivars, previously described by the breeders. For instance, the cultivars Arrehane and Aguilal known for their resistance to Hessian fly (Jlibene and Nsarellah 2011), and carrying the H22 gene (Lhaloui et al. 2000), were clearly amplified the allele of the marker Xgdm33 tightly linked to H22 (Zhao et al. 2006). In addition, Arrehane showed the presence of durable resistance gene Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 and dwarfing gene allele Rht-B1b. Other cultivars namely Baraka, Acsad-59, Jouda and Mehdia which were positive for Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 and Rht-B1b dwarfing gene allele are also known for their large adaptation, high yield and tolerance to drought (Jlibene and Nsarellah 2011). However, these cultivars need to be further improved by incorporating the Hessian fly resistance, which is very important problem in arid and semi-arid regions of Morocco and the North Africa. Based on the marker analysis, the cultivars Saada and Massira with resistance to the Hessian fly (H5 gene; Lhaloui et al. 2000) were also found to be carrying Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 slow rusting gene. The linked random DNA analysis also revealed the possibilities of having the second slow rusting gene Lr68 in Saada and Massira, which needs to be further confirmed based on the phenotypic characterization. These two cultivars with two slow rust resistance genes could be a valuable parent in wheat breeding program due the additive resistance effect resulted from combined slow rusting genes (Lillemo et al. 2011). Furthermore, the analysis in this study also revealed that the cultivar Saada also carried photoperiod insensitive allele Ppd-D1a (Yang et al. 2009) and waxy locus allele wx-B1 associated with improved starch quality (McLauchlan et al. 2001). Therefore, Saada is very valuable cultivar for use as donors in molecular breeding program. The cultivars Tilila and Mehdia revealed the presence of iag95 marker specific for 1BL.1RS translocation. Tilila showed also presence of waxy allele wx-A1 and wx-B1, low polyphenol oxidase activity alleles (Ppo-D1a and Ppo-A1b). This cultivar (Tilila) is known in Morocco for its large adaptation, moderate yield and resistance against many diseases (Jlibene 1996).\n\nEstimation of the degree of differentiation between cultivars that are included in a crossing program is useful for selection of parental genotypes. The Mexican cultivars Pavon-76, Bobwhite and Veery were genetically closer to Moroccan cultivars. Based on the knowledge of pedigrees of exotic and Moroccan cultivars and the history of Moroccan breeding, it is known that Mexican cultivars and CIMMYT germplasm were extensively used in Morocco since 1980s (Jlibene and Nsarellah 2011). Most of the Moroccan cultivars had Pavon’s and Veery or their common parents such as Bluebirds and Kalyansona as parents (Skovmand et al. 1997). The NJ dendrogram and PCoA results revealed a clear differentiation between Moroccan and the exotic cultivars deployed in the current breeding program indicating that the exotic cultivars used in this study, were divergent from Moroccan cultivars and can be used to improve disease resistance, quality and also genetic diversity.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary material 1 (DOCX 28 kb)\n\n \n\nAuthors are grateful to the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture/FAO, the European Union, the CRP-Wheat and ICARDA/Morocco Collaborative Grants Program for the financial support. The views expressed herein can in no way be taken to reflect the official opinion of the European Union.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nEthical standards\nThe experiment complies with the current laws of Morocco in which it was performed.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAhmad M   Molecular marker-assisted selection of HMW glutenin alleles related to wheat bread quality by PCR-generated DNA markers Theor Appl Genet 2000 101 892 896 10.1007/s001220051558 \nAndersen JR  Lubberstedt T   Functional markers in plants Trends Plant Sci 2003 8 554 560 10.1016/j.tplants.2003.09.010 14607101 \nBarrett BA  Kidwell KK   AFLP-based genetic diversity assessment among wheat cultivar from the Pacific Northwest Crop Sci 1998 38 1261 1271 10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800050025x \nBeales J  Turner A  Griffiths S  Snape JW  Laurie DA   Pseudo-Response Regulator is misexpressed in the photoperiod insensitive Ppd -D1a  mutant of wheat (Triticum aestivum  L.)

CAV is primarily involved in several biosynthetic processes such as ureagenesis, gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis by providing bicarbonate ion. Here, we report a new strategy for cloning, expression and purification for CAVA in the bacterial system followed by its biophysical characterization. The cDNA of CAVA, a 801 nucleotide long that encodes a 267-amino acid polypeptide of molecular mass of 30-kDa (excluding signal peptide), was sub-cloned in the expression vector pET21c and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) for expression. The recombinant protein was purified in two steps by Ni–NTA and DEAE weak anion-exchange chromatography under native condition from the supernatant, while inclusion bodies (IBs) were used to get protein under the denatured condition with a relatively high yield. CAVA was purified under denatured conditions in a single step using Ni–NTA chromatography. SDS-PAGE showed a band of 30-kDa, which was further confirmed as CAVA by Western blot and MALDI-TOF/MS. We further performed enzyme activity to ensure that both forms of purified proteins are enzymatically active. Measurements of secondary structure of the native, denatured and renatured proteins were carried out using circular dichroism. The purified protein can be further used for structural and biochemical studies.\n\nKeywords\nCarbonic anhydrase VAProtein expressionGluconeogenesisEnzyme assayCircular dichroismProtein purificationDST FISTissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nCarbonic anhydrase V (CAV) is a mitochondrial enzyme (Dodgson et al. 1980) that catalyzes the hydration of carbon dioxide to produce proton and bicarbonate. CAV exists in two closely related mitochondrial isoform known as carbonic anhydrase VA (CAVA) and CAVB which have a distinct tissue distribution (Imtaiyaz Hassan et al. 2013). CAVB is expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, salivary gland and spinal cord (Ghandour et al. 2000), while CAVA is localized in the mitochondria and expressed primarily in the liver (Saarnio et al. 1999). CAVA is actively involved in several biosynthetic processes such as ureagenesis, gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis and helps in glucose (Dodgson and Cherian 1989; Parkkila et al. 1998), fatty acid and urea synthesis (van Karnebeek et al. 2014). CAV is the only mammalian CA which is compartmentalized in a cell organelle and it has tyrosine at 64th position instead of histidine, a catalytic proton shuttle residue which transfers proton from zinc-bound water to buffer (Boriack-Sjodin et al. 1995; Vitale et al. 2007). However, the proton shuttle transport in CAV is still not clear.\n\nCAVA gene was localized to chromosome 16q24.3 and an unprocessed pseudogene has been assigned to 16p12 (Nagao et al. 1995). CAVA gene is composed of 915 nucleotides encoding a 305-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 35-kDa. It has a hydrophobic N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence of 38 amino acid residues and a catalytic domain of 267-amino acids. Based on the effect of CA inhibitors on these processes, a physiological role of CAVA in the biosynthetic processes has been suggested (Liang et al. 1993; Heck et al. 1994). In fact, mitochondria require CAV for these metabolic processes, and deregulation of this enzyme causes obesity (Arechederra et al. 2013), which is one of the most common human diseases, because of alteration in the metabolic substrate flux (Picard et al. 2000). Inhibition of CAVA has been identified as a novel anti-obesity strategy, over the other because of their serious cardiovascular or central nervous system (CNS) side effects. Several studies have provided insight that inhibition of CAVA with sulfonamide/sulfamate drug has potential as anti-obesity (Kaul and Ritschel 1988). However, better inhibitors are needed to overcome the problem of selectivity, since CAVA share a close homology, with other CA isoform, to design selective inhibitors of CAVA is challenging (Iqbal et al. 2015; Swenson 2014).\n\nWe tried to express the full length of CAVA in the bacterial system, but protein was unable to get solubilized. To overcome this problem, we have sub-cloned cDNA of CAVA into expression vector pET21c, encoding a 267-amino acid protein corresponding to the catalytic domain only (801 nucleotides and 30-kDa). Moreover, we have purified CAVA from both soluble supernatant and inclusion bodies (IBs). We further optimized the purification procedure to get the soluble proteins from inclusion bodies which have similar structure and enzyme activity in comparison to the protein purified from the supernatant. The aim of the present study is to construct a prokaryotic expression system for producing recombinant protein which can be used for structure–function studies in future.\n\nMaterials and methods\nStrains and plasmid\nClone of CAVA was purchased from PlasmID Harvard Medical School. DH5α and BL21 (DE3) strains of E. coli were used for cloning and expression of the protein, respectively. E. coli cells harboring recombinant plasmid were grown aerobically at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA). Plasmid pET-21c (Novagen, WI, USA) was used as expression vector. Plasmid isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation and competent cell preparation were carried out using standard procedure.\n\nCloning of CAVA gene\nThe 801-bp coding region (39-305aa) was amplified by PCR from plasmid pENTR2231 containing the CAVA gene using forward and reverse primers 5′CTAGCTAGCTGTGCATGGCAAACCAGCAA3′ and 5′CGGCTCGAGTAAGGACCTTTGCCCTCATTAG3′, respectively. This amplification generated Nhe1 and Xho1 sites on each end of the amplified fragment and excluded the coding region (1-38aa) for the putative signal sequence. The CAVA gene was sub-cloned into pET21c vector with the C-terminal His6 tag.\n\nExpression of recombinant protein CAVA\nThe constructed expression vector (pET21c-CAVA) containing coding region of CAVA gene was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) host cells by following the standard protocol. Overnight culture of the expression cells from a freshly transformed plate was inoculated in LB media, containing 100 μg/µl ampicillin, and incubated at 37 °C, with constant agitation at 220 rpm in an incubator shaker until the absorbance reaches 0.6 at 600 nm. The culture was induced by 0.50 mM IPTG (Sigma, Saint Louis, USA) and incubated for next 15 h at 16 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 7000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Then, cells were dissolved in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 500 mM NaCl, 5 % (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 100 mM phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 % (v/v) triton X-100 (U. S. Biochemical Corp). Cell lysate was sonicated on ice and centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected for purification of CAVA by the nickel affinity chromatography.\n\nPurification of CAVA under native condition\nA clear supernatant was passed through Ni–NTA column which was pre-equilibrated with a buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 % (v/v glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM imidazole). After binding of protein, column was washed with 50 ml of washing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 % (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM imidazole) at 4 °C. Bound protein was eluted with 300 mM imidazole. The fractions were concentrated using Amicon Ultra 10 K device (Merck Darmstadt, Germany) and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0 buffer. The dialyzed sample was further loaded on Hi Trap DEAE FF (1 ml, 7 mm × 25 mm) column (GE healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Bound proteins were eluted with increasing concentration of NaCl (0–1 M NaCl) in the 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0 buffer. Elution was controlled by Akta purifier (GE healthcare) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. CAVA eluted at 0.50 M NaCl was pooled, concentrated and stored for further study. The purity of protein was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\n\nAlternative methods of CAVA purification\nWe also report an alternative method of CAVA purification as a major portion of CAVA which was expressed as insoluble protein in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs). Earlier, we successfully purified the protein from the soluble form, but its yield was very low. To increase the yield of CAVA protein, we have tried a number of different methods to isolate the protein from IBs.\n\nPreparation and solubilization of IBs\nEscherichia coli cells were centrifuged, pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer and 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) and lysed through sonicate, and IBs in the cell lysate were pelleted by low-speed centrifugation. Then, the pellet was again resuspended and washed with milli-Q water through centrifugation thrice to remove contaminations and got purified IBs. Solubilization of IBs is a vital step to obtaining the maximal amount of desired protein. We tried various denaturing conditions, such as urea, 1 % SDS, guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) and 1 % N-lauroylsarcosine to obtain maximum amount of our protein. CAVA was solubilized in all conditions. We solubilized the purified IBs with 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl and 1 % N-lauroylsarcosine, and incubated on rocker for 30 min. We centrifuged the solubilized IBs for 30 min at 12,000 rpm and collected the supernatant.\n\nPurification of recombinant CAVA from IBs\nNi–NTA column was equilibrated with equilibration buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl and 1 % N-lauroylsarcosine). The collected supernatant was loaded on equilibrated Ni–NTA column. Then, the column was washed with washing buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl and 1 % N-lauroylsarcosine and 20 mM imidazole). The desired protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl and 0.5 % N-lauroylsarcosine and 300 mM imidazole). The fractions of eluted CAVA protein were collected and checked for homogeneity on SDS-PAGE.\n\nWestern blotting\nBand of CAVA protein on SDS-PAGE was transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane using standard procedure. Nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 5 % non-fatty acid milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h followed by three washing. Conjugate Anti-His–HRP antibody (Penta-His, Qiagen) was incubated with the membranes for another 2 h and subsequently washed to remove the unbound antibody. Blot was developed by incubating the membrane for 2 min with 3, 30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) reagents (Zhongshan Biotech, Beijing) and 200 μl hydrogen peroxide.\n\nMass spectrometry\nTo know the amino acid sequence of purified protein, we performed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF/MS). The band of CAVA from the SDS-PAGE was excised for tryptic digestion and subjected to mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Shimadzu Group Company, Japan). We used standard procedure for the sequencing of CAVA, which was described elsewhere in detail (Hassan et al. 2007a, 2008). The peptide mass finger prints were used to identify protein by searching the SWISS-PROT and NCBI-nr databases using the Mascot 2.0 search engine with fragment mass tolerance of ±0.5 Da and max missed cleavages of one (Table 1).Table 1 List of peptide fragments obtained after trypsinization\n\nStart–end\tObserved\tNominal mass (expected)\tNominal mass (calculated)\tppm\tPeptide\t\n38–63\t2865.4580\t2864.4507\t2864.4028\t17\tR.

The p-nitrophenyl acetate (NPA) was used as the substrate to measure the activity of CAVA by recording the increase of absorbance at 400 nm (Ikai et al. 1978). The reaction cuvette contained 0.1 mM p-nitrophenyl acetate in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 % acetonitrile and enzyme in the concentration of 0.3 mg/ml for both CAII and CAVA at 25 °C. We have taken CAII as a positive control for activity. Esterase activity was carried out by following the release of nitrophenol which was measured at 400 nm by spectrophotometer (Jasco V-660, Model B 028661152) equipped with Peltier-type temperature controller (ETCS-761). All spectral measurements were done at least three times at 25 ± 0.1 °C.\n\nCircular dichroism\nSecondary structure of CAVA was measured using circular dichroism (CD) in Jasco spectropolarimeter (model J-1500) equipped with Peltier type temperature controller. The far-UV CD spectra (250–200 nm) were recorded at 25 ± 0.1 °C using a cuvette of 1 mm path length cell and protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml (10 μM). Samples of the native and renatured CAVA were prepared in 50 mM Tris–HCl and 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 150 mM NaCl at pH 8.0 and 7.0, respectively. Denatured sample was prepared in phosphate buffer with 1 % N-lauroylsarcosine at pH 7.0. The raw CD data were converted to the mean residue ellipticity, [θ] (degrees cm2 dmol−1), using the relation: 1 [θ=Mo[θ]/10lc where [θ] is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, Mo is the mean residue weight of the protein, c is the concentration in mg/ml, and l is the path length of the cell in centimetre. The CD spectra were uploaded onto the K2D2 server to estimate the secondary structural content of CAVA (Perez-Iratxeta and Andrade-Navarro 2008). This server is based on the comparison of real and predicted values, by means of the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of proteins with known three-dimensional structure. A detail of algorithm is described elsewhere (Johnson 1999; McPhie 2008; Sreerama and Woody 2000).\n\nResults\nCloning and expression of CAVA\nThe CAVA gene from plasmid pENTR223 was amplified by PCR, with Nhe1 and Xho1 site at the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. The amplified product was 801 bp long (Fig. 1a). It was digested with same restriction enzymes Nhe1 and Xho1, and subsequently ligated to the pET21c Nhe1 and Xho1 backbone fragment. This clone was confirmed by colony PCR (Fig. 1b) and restriction digestion with Nhe1 and Xho1 endonucleases (Fig. 1c). Constructed plasmid was further verified by DNA sequencing (not shown). The confirmed plasmid constructed pET21c-CAVA was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Recombinant protein was expressed at 16 °C by inducing with 0.5 mM IPTG. Overexpression of CAVA was clearly indicated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight of 30-kDa (Fig. 2a).Fig. 1 Cloning of CAVA gene: a amplified CAVA gene.

Lane 1 is a molecular mass marker and lane 2 shows purified CAVA\n\n\n\nPurification of CAVA under native condition\nTo purify proteins in biologically active form from bacterial system, require an optimization of expression, solubilization of IBs and refolding experiments. Here, we expressed CAVA in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The major portion of the protein was expressed as insoluble fractions. Hence, we have purified CAVA successfully under the native as well as denatured conditions. The recombinant CAVA protein was isolated and purified to homogeneity at 4 °C from cell extract under the native condition. CAVA was found in the soluble bacterial extract, and obtained after the centrifugation of sonicated E. coli cell at 20,000g. CAVA was purified to homogeneity by two chromatographic steps on Ni–NTA affinity chromatography and DEAE ion-exchange chromatography. The eluted fractions after Ni–NTA affinity chromatography showed a significant level of contamination by other proteins (Fig. 2b). Eluted fractions were pooled, extensively dialyzed and loaded on to the DEAE anion exchanger column to get pure CAVA. Elution profile of DEAE anion exchanger column chromatography is shown in Fig. 2c. Fractions of protein obtained in DEAE anion exchanger column were subjected to SDS-PAGE to check the purity. A clear single band was observed on SDS-PAGE indicating the purity of CAVA (Fig. 2d). A summary of CAVA purification procedure is provided in Table 2.Table 2 Purification summary\n\nS. no.\tPurification step\tVolume (ml)\tProtein (mg/ml)b\n\tTotal protein (mg)\tYield (100 %)\t\n1\t\nE. coli cell pelleta\n\t60\t43.91\t2635.02\t100\t\n2\tSupernatant\t56\t1.428\t79.968\t3.034\t\n3\tNi-affinity chromatography\t15\t0.136\t2.04\t0.077\t\n4\tWeak anion chromatography (DEAE column)\t2\t0.504\t1.008\t0.038\t\n\naFrom 8 g of wet weight E. coli cell pellet (from 4 litre of batch)\n\n\nbProtein concentration determined by Lowry assay using BSA as a standard protein\n\n\n\nPurification of CAVA under denatured condition\nTo improve protein yield, we purified CAVA protein under denatured condition from IBs because large portion of recombinant CAVA protein was expressed there. We isolated IBs from cell extract and purified by sequential washing with milli-Q water to remove contaminants, especially non-specific proteins and proteases. Purified IBs of 30 kDa were checked on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3a). We used 1 % N-lauroylsarcosine to solubilize the IBs among other denaturants because of problems in downstream processes. Solubilized IBs were loaded on an Ni–NTA affinity chromatography and purified in single chromatography step. The purity and yield of fractions of purified CAVA were checked on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3 Purification of CAVA under denatured condition. a SDS-PAGE showing expression of CAVA in IBs. Lane 1 shows a marker and lane 2 is for CAVA, b SDS-PAGE shows an eluent obtained from Ni–NTA column chromatography (lanes 1–4  and 6) and lane 5 is marker (prestained protein marker, broad range (7–175 kDa)\n\n\n\nRefolding of CAVA\nRefolding of the protein is an important process to remove excess denaturants and provide appropriate condition for protein to spontaneously refold into correct conformation. There is no standard protocol for refolding of proteins. We refolded CAVA by dialyzing the solution against 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and 150 mM NaCl for 24 h at 4 °C. Dialyzed protein was centrifuged to remove any precipitate formed during refolding. To further check that refolded protein is enzymatically active, we performed an enzyme assay. CAVA catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-acetate to p-nitrophenol, measured by recording the increase in absorbance with time. A significant increase in the optical density of solution at 400 nm clearly suggests that purified native and renatured CAVA is enzymatically active (data not shown).\n\nSequencing and identification\nThe CAVA was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 4a) and mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF (Fig. 4b). Mass spectrometry analysis identified many fragments of CAVA, clearly indicating this protein as human mitochondrial CAVA (Table 1). Both these studies clearly indicate that purified protein is CAVA.Fig. 4 \na Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of recombinant CAVA protein. b Peptide mass fingerprint of CAVA\n\n\n\nSecondary structure measurement\nTo estimate secondary structure contents, we performed the far-UV CD of denatured, renatured and native CAVA proteins at 25 °C in the region of 250 to 200 nm (Fig. 5). Spectra were analyzed to determine the secondary structure content of the protein with available programme (Perez-Iratxeta and Andrade-Navarro 2008). We used K2D2 server and found the secondary structural contents of the native CAVA as 20.2 % α-helix, 29.1 % β-sheet and 50.7 % random coil, for the renatured CAVA as 21.7 % α-helix, 27.2 % β-sheet and 51.3 % random coil, and for the denatured CAVA contents as 15.3 % α- helix, 21.7 % β-sheet and 63 % random coil. The crystal structure of human CAVA is not determined so far. However, we calculated the secondary structure content through secondary structure prediction server and homology modeling and a considerable correlation was observed between the theoretical calculation of secondary structure and calculation of the CD data. Moreover, refolding study clearly indicates that CAVA is a reversibly denatured protein.Fig. 5 Far-UV CD spectra of recombinant protein CAVA. Curves 1, 2 and 3 represent spectra of denatured, renatured and native proteins, respectively\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWe have successfully cloned, expressed and purified human CAVA (CAVA), which lacks the first 38 amino acid N-terminal residues for putative mitochondrial signal sequence. This is the first report of human CAVA protein purified in the bacterial system in both native and denatured conditions. However, mouse mitochondrial CAVB was successfully expressed and purified from bacterial system, but truncated form of CAVB (CAVB) could not be purified from the bacterial system due to its toxicity for host (Heck et al. 1994). We compared human CAVA with mouse CAVB, because it has 85 % homology and will try to find out the reason why truncated form of human CAVA is not toxic. We purified CAVA using the combination of Ni–NTA affinity and anion exchange chromatography used to purify recombinant protein yielded a pure and homogeneous protein but yield is very low under native conditions. We also used alternate methods to improve yield, prepared IBs and isolated CAVA from it under denaturing conditions. We successfully solubilized IBs using 1 % N-lauroylsarcosine, purified through Ni–NTA chromatography only, single step purification and refolded into biologically active form. Our yield has been improved, and it is around 40 mg/litre. We identified and confirmed the purified protein by Western bolting as well as MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. The expression and purification procedures reported in this study have provided a simple and efficient method to obtain pure CAVA protein used for further studies of its structure and function.\n\nWe have successfully cloned, expressed and purified CAVA protein in E. coli. We found that purified CAVA from their IBs under denatured condition is a good approach as we got high purity and concentration in single step. We are working on structure-based drug design (Hassan et al. 2007a, b, c; Shahbaaz et al. 2015) and discovery and CAVA is considered as a potential drug target, and some of its inhibitors may lead to the development of novel anti-obesity therapies (Arechederra et al. 2013; De Simone and Supuran 2007). Furthermore, structure analysis with docking and MD simulation will further guide to design a potent and selective inhibitor of CAV which will be validated experimentally.\n\nWe sincerely thank the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India for FIST support.

Medium supplemented with 0.5 % chitin and peptone, at initial pH 8.0, when incubated at 35 °C for 72 h favored highest chitinase production. The enzyme was purified 25.1-fold to homogeneity. The chitinase was found to be thermostable and alkali-tolerant with maximum activity at pH 8.0 and 70 °C for 1 h. The molecular weight of chitinase was found to be 64 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mg2+, Co2+, Ca2+ and Mn2+ improved the chitinase activity. The Km and Vmax values of the enzyme were 0.13 mg/ml and 38.23 U/ml, respectively. When subjected to dual plate assay, the bacterium showed 45 % antagonism against F. oxysporum. Thus, it could be inferred that cultural conditions strongly affected the chitinase production by B. pumilus JUBCH08. The enzyme being thermostable and best functional under alkaline conditions could be useful for the feed industry and related biotechnological applications. Inhibition of F. oxysporum by the culture through lytic mechanism indicates its potentiality as a biocontrol agent.\n\nKeywords\nBacillus pumilusMarineChitinaseThermostableAlkali-tolerantBiocontrolissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nChitin, an insoluble polysaccharide, is one of the most abundant biopolymers on earth and is composed of linear chains of β-1, 4-N–acetyl glucosamine residues that are highly cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. Chitin as a structural polysaccharide is present in the fungal cell wall, nematodes, exoskeleton of insects and outer shell of crustaceans. Chitin forms a significant proportion of dry weight of the waste generated from shellfish industry (Wang and Chang 1997). Annually, shellfish production and processing industry contribute to the accumulation of a substantial amount of chitin rich waste that may prove to be an environmental hazard (Wang et al. 2002).\n\nFrom the environmental point of view, chitin utilization is extremely essential for proper carbon–nitrogen balance. The utilization of chitinous wastes often involves corrosive chemicals resulting in high cost, low product yields and environmental toxicity. Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) are widespread in several bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi and higher plants (Swiontek Brzezinska et al. 2014).\n\nBacteria synthesize chitinase to breakdown chitin and metabolize it as carbon and energy sources (Lien et al. 2007). Numerous species of Bacillus had been reported to synthesize chitinase and act as biocontrol agents since they display antagonism against a wide range of plant pathogens that infect several economically important crops (Collins et al. 2003).\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the use of chitinases is limited as the production and characteristics of chitinases often do not satisfy the industrial standards. Therefore, efforts must be directed toward finding newer sources of chitinases, better production strategies and ability of these chitinases to function under a wide range of temperature and pH. Studies on media optimization for chitinase production are a worthwhile approach because different media constituents may affect the production of microbial chitinases. Simultaneously, enzyme characterization is equally important to determine the optimal conditions under which the enzyme demonstrates its maximum activity. The present study aims at isolation and identification of a potent chitinolytic bacterium from marine sediment, optimized production, purification and characterization of chitinase and testing in vitro antagonistic activity of the bacterial isolate against phytopathogenic Fusarium oxysporum.\n\nMaterials and methods\nChemicals and reagents\nAll the analytical grade chemicals and media components used in the experiments were purchased from HiMedia, Mumbai, India.\n\nSource of fungal culture\nFusarium oxysporum MTCC 7678 was obtained from Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene Bank (MTCC), Chandigarh, India. The fungus was propagated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and stored at 4 °C until further used.\n\nSampling\nBottom sediment for microbiological analysis was collected from the littoral zone (down to 5 cm) of Elliot’s Beach, Chennai Tamil Nadu, India (12.99°N 80.27°E). Following collection, sediment was aseptically transferred in a sterile zip-lock cover, stored in a container with ice and transported to the laboratory, where it was immediately processed (Donderski and Trzebiatowska 2000).\n\nIsolation of chitinase producing bacteria\nChitinase producing bacteria were isolated from the marine sediment sample using serial dilution and spread plate technique on mineral salt medium with the following composition (g/l) along with 1 % (w/v) colloidal chitin: (NH4)2SO4, 0.28; NH4Cl, 0.23; KH2PO4, 0.0067; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.04; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.022; FeCl3·6H2O, 0.005; yeast extract, 0.2; NaCl, 0.015; NaHCO3, 1.0 and 1 ml/l of trace element solution containing (g/l) ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01; MnCl2·4H2O, 0.1; CuSO4·5H2O, 0.392; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.248; NaB4O7·10H2O, 0.177 and NiCl2·H2O, 0.02 with glucose (1 % w/v). The plates were incubated at 30 ± 2 °C for 5 days and following incubation examined for the appearance of bacterial colonies. The colonies showing clear zones against a cream background were considered as chitinase producers and maintained on chitin agar slants.\n\nScreening of chitinase producing bacteria\nAll the above isolates were individually inoculated in 100 ml of mineral salt broth supplemented with colloidal chitin (1 % w/v) and incubated at 30 ± 2 °C, 120 rpm for 5 days. Following incubation, the respective cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell-free supernatants were analyzed for enzyme activity (Kuddus and Ahmad 2013).\n\nChitinase assay\nThe individual reaction mixture consisted of 1 ml of individual culture supernatant, 1 ml of 1 % (w/v) colloidal chitin in citrate phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 5.5) and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. Following incubation, all the reaction mixtures were put in boiling water bath for a period of 2–3 min to stop the enzyme action. The solutions were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The amount of reducing sugar in the supernatants was determined by dinitrosalicylic acid method (Miller 1959). One enzyme unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that liberated 1 μmol of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine per minute under the standard assay conditions. The isolate demonstrating highest chitinase activity was selected for further study. The soluble protein contents of the enzyme samples were determined by Lowry’s method (Lowry et al. 1951).\n\nMolecular identification of selected bacterial isolate\nThe total genomic DNA was extracted from the bacterial cells using Bacterial Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Chromous Biotech Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India) according to the manufacturer instructions and checked for its quality and concentration using 0.8 % (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\n16S rDNA region was amplified using universal forward 16S rDNA primer (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and universal reverse 16S rDNA primer (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′). The PCR amplification was performed using the ABI 2720 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) with 5 min initial denaturation at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles that consisted of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 55 °C and extension at 72 °C for 1 min and a final extension of 5 min at 72 °C. Each reaction mixture contained 1 μl genomic DNA, 4 μl of dNTP’s (2.5 mM each); 10 μl of Taq DNA polymerase assay buffer and 1 μl Taq DNA polymerase (3 U/μl) (Chromous Biotech Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India) and the volume was made up to 100 μl using sterile distilled water. The PCR amplified product was eluted from the gel using Gel Extraction Spin-50 kit (Chromous Biotech Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India) according to the manufacturer instructions and detected by 1.2 % agarose gel (with ethidium bromide) electrophoresis.\n\nThe partial 16S rDNA sequencing of the PCR amplicon was performed at Chromous Biotech Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India using Big Dye Terminator Version 3.1 cycles sequencing kit and ABI 3500 XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The resultant nucleotide sequence was analyzed using the software Seq Scape version 5.2. The 16S rDNA sequence was aligned manually with the available nucleotide sequences retrieved from the NCBI database using BLASTn (Altschul et al. 1990). The nucleotide sequence was submitted to GenBank database (NCBI, USA) and was provided an accession number.\n\nOptimization of chitinase production\nTo determine the optimum concentration of colloidal chitin for chitinase production, the isolate was grown in the presence of different concentrations (0.1–2 % w/v) of colloidal chitin. Effect of nitrogen sources (0.1 % w/v: peptone, tryptone, yeast extract, beef extract, ammonium sulfate, urea and sodium nitrate) on chitinase production was studied. Physical parameters such as initial pH (4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9), incubation temperature (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 °C) and incubation time (24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h) were optimized for maximum chitinase production by the selected isolate.\n\nEnzyme purification\nThe cell-free supernatant of the chitinolytic isolate JUBCH08 was subjected to ammonium sulfate (70 % w/v) precipitation at 4 °C. The resulting precipitate obtained by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C was dissolved in phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.0), and dialyzed against the same buffer for 24 h. The dialyzed fraction was subjected to gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-200 column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the phosphate buffer. Fractions were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions showing highest chitinase activity were pooled, concentrated and further purified using DEAE-Sepharose column (1.5 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated with 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The purified chitinase was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (0 to 0.5 M) in the same buffer. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml/min. The active fractions having chitinase activity were collected, concentrated and used for characterization (Zhu et al. 2007). The molecular weight of purified chitinase was determined by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli 1970).\n\nCharacterization of chitinase\nThe effect of pH on chitinase activity was evaluated using 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.0–6.0), 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.0–9.0), and 0.1 M glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10.0). pH stability of the enzyme was measured by incubating the enzyme at room temperature for 0–3 h in the buffer supporting the highest enzyme activity. The effect of temperature on chitinase activity was determined by exposing the reaction mixture at 10–100 °C at the optimum pH. Thermostability of the chitinase was assessed by incubating the enzyme for 0–3 h at the temperature supporting the highest activity. In both instances aliquots of the enzyme were collected at intervals of 30 min, cooled and the residual enzyme activity was determined as per standard assay procedure. Effect of various metal ions (chloridized Ca2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Hg2+, Ag+, Fe3+ and sulfated Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Mn2+) was determined by preincubation of the enzyme with 1 mM concentration of each metal salt at the optimum pH and temperature for 30 min. The Michaelis constant (Km) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme were determined from the double reciprocal plot by varying the colloidal chitin concentration from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/ml (Lineweaver and Burk 1934).\n\nAntagonistic activity against phytopathogenic F. oxysporum MTCC 7678\nThe fungal growth inhibition capacity of the selected bacterial isolate was determined by dual plate assay (Huang et al. 2005). Pure culture of F. oxysporum MTCC 7678 (5 mm agar plug) was placed at two opposite corners of PDA plate. The bacterial culture was inoculated at the center. Plates were incubated at 28 ± 2 °C for 5 days. Following incubation, growth diameter of the fungal pathogen was measured. In the control plate, the bacterial culture was replaced by sterile distilled water. Result was expressed as mean of the percentages of inhibition of F. oxysporum MTCC 7678 growth in the presence of the bacterial isolate.\n\nPercentage inhibition was calculated using the following formula Percentage of inhibition=1-Fungal growth/Control growth×100 \n\nMycelial morphology from the control and test plates was observed after staining with lactophenol cotton blue under binocular light microscope (Labomed, India).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll the optimization studies were conducted in triplicate and the data were analyzed using single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). All the data are graphically presented as mean ± SD of triplicates (n = 3). ANOVA was performed using Microsoft Excel 2007. P values < 0.05 were considered significant with a confidence limit of 95 %.\n\nResults and discussion\nIsolation and screening of chitinase producing bacteria\nTwenty-one chitinolytic bacterial isolates were isolated from the marine sediment sample plated on mineral salt medium supplemented with 1.0 % w/v colloidal chitin. Among these, nine isolates showed chitinolytic zones corresponding to 15–20 mm. When these nine chitinolytic isolates were introduced in liquid medium, chitinase activity ranging between 6.8 and 13.1 U/ml was recorded. Isolate JUBCH08 which showed the highest enzyme production was selected for further studies.\n\nMolecular identification of the selected isolate\n16S rDNA sequencing is a powerful tool for rapid identification and phylogenetic analysis of bacterial species. The apparent size of the PCR amplicon was ~1.5 kbp. The obtained 620 bp 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence was compared with available 16S ribosomal sequences in the NCBI database using BLASTn. The JUBCH08 isolate has been enrolled into a cluster containing Bacillus sp. and was found to be closely related to Bacillus pumilus strain XJ-117 with 99 % sequence similarity. Hence, it was designated as Bacillus pumilus JUBCH08. This nucleotide sequence submitted to GenBank was provided an accession number KC588945.\n\nEffect of colloidal chitin concentration\nSince chitinase is an inducible enzyme, maximum chitinase is produced when the production medium contains optimum concentration of colloidal chitin as the substrate. Different colloidal chitin concentrations (0.1–2 % w/v) were investigated for chitinase production by B. pumilus JUBCH08, where the bacterial culture produced maximum chitinase (16.2 U/ml) when supplemented with 0.5 % (w/v) of colloidal chitin. Beyond this substrate concentration the enzyme activity decreased to reach a level of 8.3 U/ml with 2 % w/v of chitin in the medium.\n\nA decline in chitinase production beyond 0.5 % (w/v) colloidal chitin concentration may indicate reduced utilization of colloidal chitin as substrate, or accumulation of intermediate metabolites produced from chitin decomposition, which might have inhibited the enzyme synthesis. According to the Michaelis–Menten equation, it may be hypothesized that the rate of an enzymatic reaction is directly proportional to the substrate concentration at a lower percentage. The greater the substrate concentration, the lesser would be its influence on microbial growth and rate of enzymatic reaction (Allison et al. 2014).\n\nWhile solid-state cultivation of B. thuringiensis R 176 with shrimp shells and rice straw as a substrate for chitinase production was studied, the optimal medium contained 0.5 % (w/v) ball-milled chitin (Chaiharn et al. 2013). Thus, the present findings emphasize that chitinase production could be correlated with colloidal chitin concentration in the medium.\n\nEffect of nitrogen sources\nAmong the different organic and inorganic nitrogen sources added to the mineral salt broth, peptone was the most effective nitrogenous additive resulting in highest chitinase production (25.5 U/ml). Ammonium sulfate acted as the best inorganic nitrogen source (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Effect of nitrogen supplements on chitinase production by B. pumilus JUBCH08. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3); P < 0.05\n\n\n\nIn general, chitinase production was improved by addition of organic nitrogen than inorganic nitrogen. This might be due to the fact that organic nitrogen sources contain most types of amino acids and growth factors vital for bacterial growth and could be metabolized directly by the cells, consequently promoting chitinase production. However, the present finding also indicates that ammonium sulfate acting as an inorganic nitrogen source may be used for large scale chitinase production as an alternative to peptone.\n\nWang et al. (2001) reported that peptone (0.1 % w/v) induced high levels of chitinase from B.cereus. Incorporation of different organic and inorganic nitrogen sources in the media resulted in maximum chitinase production by B. cereus JF68 in the presence of peptone (Jabeen and Qazi 2014).\n\nEffect of initial pH of the medium\nThe pH of the immediate external environment partially governs the cytoplasmic pH and is believed to affect the rate of enzyme mediated reaction and structure of many biological molecules including proteins and nucleic acids. The present study reports appreciable chitinase production between pH 6.0 and 9.0, with the maximum (29.4 U/ml) recorded at pH 8.0. Decrease in enzyme yield was observed under acidic conditions (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2 Effect of physical parameters on chitinase production by B. pumilus JUBCH08. a Chitinase activity under the influence of initial pH of the medium. b Chitinase activity at different incubation temperatures. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3); P < 0.05\n\n\n\nThe probable reason for maximum production of chitinase at pH 8.0 by B. pumilus JUBCH08 could be because most microbial extracellular enzymes are best produced at pH supporting maximum enzyme activity (Mc Tigue et al. 1994). The present observation is in corroboration with an earlier report where chitinase production by B. pabuli K1 was optimum at pH 8.0 (Frändberg and Schnürer 1994).\n\nEffect of incubation temperature\nIn bioprocesses, specific temperature requirement and its regulation are the most critical parameters because cultivation temperature affects protein synthesis by influencing the rate of biochemical reactions within the microbial cell and thereby consequently inducing or repressing enzyme production (Nascimento and Martins 2004).\n\nWhen B. pumilus JUBCH08 was grown at 20–50 °C, chitinase production was maximum (34.7 U/ml) at 35 °C. The enzyme production decreased above 40 °C (Fig. 2b). This result indicated the organism’s mesophilic preference for enzyme production. The present observation regarding the effect of incubation temperature on chitinase production is in complete agreement with a previous finding that reported 35 °C as the optimum temperature for chitinase production by B. amyloliquefaciens SM3 strain (Das et al. 2012).\n\nEffect of incubation time\nThe chitinase yield was initially low and after a lag phase of approximately 48 h, the yield gradually increased. Maximum chitinase production (39.3 U/ml) was recorded at 72 h of incubation, beyond which the chitinase production reduced rapidly.\n\nFrom the present observation, it may be anticipated that the initial linear nature of chitinase production by B. pumilus JUBCH08 was probably due to the fact that chitin being a hard-decomposable compound, longer time was needed by the bacterial culture to adapt to this substrate to produce chitinase. Till 72 h of incubation, N-acetyl glucosamine liberated by the chitinase activity was possibly used by B. pumilus JUBCH08 as a carbon and nitrogen source. Beyond 72 h, greater amount of accumulated N-acetyl glucosamine might have hampered further production of the enzyme by a feedback mechanism. The other possible reason for the decrease in chitinase yield might be due to activation of proteinase mediated degradation or inactivation of the chitinase by unclear mechanisms (Donderski and Trzebiatowska 2000).\n\nPurification profile of chitinase\nAs summarized in Table 1, the chitinase from B. pumilus JUBCH08 was purified by the combination of several purification steps. The chitinase was purified to 25.1-fold in three steps with a recovery of 74.7 %. We relate the decrease in total chitinase activity to the loss of enzyme during the purification steps.Table 1 Purification summary of chitinase produced by B. pumilus JUBCH08\n\nSteps\tActivity (U/ml)\tProtein content (mg)\tSpecific activity (U/mg)\tRecovery (%)\tPurification fold\t\nCrude enzyme\t40.34\t390\t0.10\t100\t1.0\t\nAmmonium sulfate desalted\t37.45\t170\t0.22\t92.8\t2.2\t\nSephade× G-200\t35.16\t29\t1.21\t87.1\t12.1\t\nDEAE-sepharose\t30.17\t12\t2.51\t74.7\t25.1\t\n\n\nEffect of pH on chitinase activity and stability\nThe chitinase from B. pumilus JUBCH08 showed better enzyme activity at alkaline pH range as compared to the acidic pH range, wherein pH 8.0 supported maximum enzyme activity. At pH 8.0, the chitinase retained approximately 97 and 64 % of the original activity for 1 and 3 h, respectively (Fig. 3a).Fig. 3 Residual chitinase activity at different time intervals. a Activity at pH 8.0. b Activity at 70 °C. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3); P < 0.05\n\n\n\nThe chitinase from B. pumilus JUBCH08 was different from many other bacterial chitinases in having its pH optima at pH 8.0. Characterization of a novel chitinase from B. brevis revealed that the enzymatic activity was stable at pH 6–10 and the enzyme was most active at pH 8.0 (Li et al. 2002). The purified chitinase from B.licheniformis SK-1 revealed activity optima at pH 6 and 8, respectively, when colloidal chitin was used as substrate (Kudan and Pichyangkura 2009).\n\nEffect of temperature on chitinase activity and stability\nIn the present study, the chitinase was stable over a wide range of temperature (50–80 °C) with the maximum activity recorded at 70 °C. The enzyme retained approximately 94 and 37 % of its original activity for 1 h and 3 h, respectively, at 70 °C (Fig. 3b). Similar to the present study, the optimal temperature and pH of the chitinase produced by B. licheniformis MB-2 were 70 °C and 6.0, respectively (Toharisman et al. 2005).\n\nEffect of metal ions on chitinase activity\nThe chitinase activity of B. pumilus JUBCH08 increased in the presence of Mg2+, Co2+, Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions. Zn2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions slightly inhibited the chitinase activity, whereas Fe3+, Ag+ and Hg2+ proved to be inhibitory (Fig. 4). The result from the present study indicated that metal ions influenced the chitinase activity. This is in agreement with earlier studies wherein the chitinases from Bacillus MH-1 and Bacillus sp. DAU101 were activated by Mn2+ and Co2+, respectively (Sakai et al. 1998; Lee et al. 2007).Fig. 4 Effect of metal ions on residual chitinase activity. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3); P < 0.05\n\n\n\nMichaelis and rate constant determination\nThe Km and Vmax values of the enzyme were 0.13 mg/ml and 38.23 U/ml, respectively. These results are significant as the small Km value indicates a high affinity of the enzyme toward the substrate (Plalmer 1987).\n\nDetermination of molecular weight\nThe purified chitinase was a monomer with an apparent molecular weight of 64 kDa. In corroboration to the present finding, chitinase from B. licheniformis Mb-2 was found to have a molecular weight of 67 kDa (Toharisman et al. 2005). The molecular mass of the exochitinase from B.thuringiensis subsp. pakistani was 66 kDa (Thamthianku et al. 2001).\n\nAntagonistic activity against phytopathogenic fungus\nAntagonistic activity of several Bacillus species against a number of pathogenic fungi is well documented. By the dual plate method, 45 % inhibition of F. oxysporum MTCC 7678 hyphae was observed when cultured in the presence of B. pumilus JUBCH08. However, in the control plate, no inhibition of the fungal hyphae was recorded. This antagonistic mechanism is majorly attributed to the action of bacterial chitinase on the fungal cell wall which contains chitin as a major structural component. Microscopic observation of F. oxysporum MTCC 7678 mycelia near the zone of inhibition revealed marked morphological changes in hyphae (hyphae appearing swollen, vacuolated, fragmented and distorted) compared to mycelia observed (intact without any distortion) in the control plate (Fig. 5). These morphological changes in the fungal hyphae when cultured in the presence of B. pumilus JUBCH08 are evidences of the bacterial chitinase activity on the fungal cell wall (Taechowisan et al. 2003).Fig. 5 Mycelial inhibition of F. oxysporum by B. pumilus JUBCH08 in dual culture method, a PDA plate inoculated with F. oxysporum (control), b PDA plate inoculated with F. oxysporum and B. pumilus JUBCH08. Light microscopic observations of mycelial changes in F. oxysporum from the zone of interaction (magnification: 400×), c intact mycelium from the control plate, indicated by black arrow, d swollen and ruptured mycelium from the plate showing zone of inhibition, indicated by black arrow\n\n\n\n\nWilt is a widespread plant disease caused by many forms of soil-inhabiting Fusarium, especially F. oxysporum. Several investigations were undertaken to venture into the biological control of F. oxysporum by chitinolytic bacteria. The result of the dual plate assay presented here supports the mechanism of antagonism of B. pumilus JUBCH08 against F. oxysporum MTCC 7678 mediated through chitinase production. Several studies have demonstrated that bacterial chitinases can cause deformation and inhibition of viable fungal hyphae (Ashwini and Srividya 2014).\n\nConclusions\nThe present investigation revealed that B. pumilus JUBCH08 is a potent chitinase producer. Medium supplemented with chitin and peptone, at initial pH 8.0, when incubated at 35 °C for 72 h favored highest chitinase production. The chitinase was unique in some properties, being functional under alkaline conditions and displaying thermostability at 70 °C for 1 h. The results of the dual plate assay emphasized that the chitinolytic bacterium greatly inhibited the fungal pathogen through lytic mechanism, a characteristic that may be utilized for the formulation of a biocontrol agent as an alternative to harmful chemical pesticides.\n\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to the management of Jain University for providing the research facilities.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n==== Refs\nReferences\nAllison SD  Chacon SS  German DP   Substrate concentration constraints on microbial decomposition Soil Biol Biochem 2014 79 43 49 10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.08.021 \nAltschul SF  Gish W  Miller W  Myers EW  Lipman DJ   Basic local alignment search tool J Mol Biol 1990 215 403 410 10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80360-2 2231712 \nAshwini N  Srividya S   Potentiality of Bacillus subtilis  as biocontrol agent for management of anthracnose disease of chilli caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides  OGC1. 3 Biotech 2014 4 127 136 \nChaiharn M  Lumyong S  Hasan N  Plikomol A   Solid-state cultivation of Bacillus thuringiensis  R 176 with shrimp shells and rice straw as a substrate for chitinase production Ann Microbiol 2013 63 443 450 10.1007/s13213-012-0488-6 \nCollins DP  Jacobsen BJ  Maxwell B   Spatial and temperal population dynamics of a phyllosphere colonizing Bacillus subtilis  biological control agent of sugar beet cercospora leaf spot Biol Control 2003 26 224 232 10.1016/S1049-9644(02)00146-9 \nDas MP  Rebecca JL  Sharmila S  Banerjee A  Kumar D   Identification and optimization of cultural conditions for chitinase production by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  SM3 J Chem Pharm Res 2012 4 4816 4821 \nDonderski W  Trzebiatowska M   Influence of physical and chemical factors on the activity of chitinases produced by planktonic bacteria isolated from Jeziorak Lake Pol J Environ Stud 2000 9 77 82 \nFrändberg E  Schnürer J   Chitinolytic properties of Bacillus pabuli  K1 J Appl Bacteriol 1994 76 361 367 10.1111/j.1365-2672.1994.tb01641.x 8200864 \nHuang CJ  Wang TK  Chung SC  Chen CY   Identification of an antifungal chitinase from a potential biocontrol agent, Bacillus cereus  J Biochem Mol Biol Sci 2005 38 82 88 10.5483/BMBRep.2005.38.1.082 \nJabeen F  Qazi JI   Isolation of chitinase yielding Bacillus cereus  JF68 from soil employing an edible crab shell chitin J Sci Ind Res 2014 73 771 776 \nKudan S  Pichyangkura R   Purification and characterization of thermostable chitinase from Bacillus licheniformis  SK-1 Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2009 157 23 35 10.1007/s12010-008-8328-7 19190863 \nKuddus SM  Ahmad RIZ   Isolation of novel chitinolytic bacteria and production optimization of extracellular chitinase J Genet Eng Biotechnol 2013 11 39 46 10.1016/j.jgeb.2013.03.001 \nLaemmli UK   Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4 Nature 1970 227 680 685 10.1038/227680a0 5432063 \nLee YS  Park IH  Yoo JS  Chung SY  Lee YC  Cho YS  Ahn SC  Kim CM  Choi YL   Cloning, purification, and characterization of chitinase from Bacillus  sp.
